(anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime. He is the older brother of [[Mokuba Kaiba|Mokuba]]. He is the modern-day lookalike counterpart of [[Seto]], an ancient Egyptian guardian, who once controlled the [[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (character)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]].\n\nAdopted into the Kaiba family as an orphan, Kaiba is at the helm of the world's largest multinational gaming conglomerate, Kaiba Corp, serving as its majority owner and CEO. An intellectually gifted and innovative computer programmer, engineer, and inventor during his youth, he invented virtual software for playing video games as a young child prodigy. Nonetheless, an estranged relationship with his adoptive father and outsmarting him auspiciously led Kaiba towards a seamless corporate takeover of KaibaCorp. With access to vast wealth, technological resources, and a wellspring of scientific and business expertise, Kaiba seeks to expand Kaiba Corp not just across Domino City but the entire world. A competitive businessman and cutthroat investor, Kaiba also seeks to become the world's greatest player in ''[[Duel Monsters]]''. To accomplish this goal, he must defeat his arch-rival, [[Yugi Muto]].  \n\nKaiba is largely considered an antihero, as his motives are usually egocentric and his personality traits are selfish and arrogant, but he does sometimes help Yugi and his friends if it's in his best interest (although there are a few occasions where he helps Yugi when faced with a common enemy). \n\nAmong one of the recurring plots is Seto Kaiba being forced to deal with either people adversely affected by [[Gozaburo Kaiba]]'s actions, wanting to take their revenge on Seto himself, or people from within KaibaCorp attempting to take over the million-dollar corporation.\n\n==Design==\n===Conception===\nKaiba is based on a collectible card games player whom a friend of [[Kazuki Takahashi]] met. Takahashi's friend asked this person to teach him how to play a card game, but he replied \"Hmph! Come back when you've collected 10,000 cards\". The story made Takahashi mad, but thought the player would make a good character.<ref>''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist'' Volume 10: \"[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist - Volume 010|The Egyptian God Cards]]\": foreword</ref>\n\nTakahashi had originally considered making Kaiba the heir to a gaming company and have him challenge Yugi using strange games he continuously comes up with, but on short notice, ended up having him play ''Duel Monsters'' a second time. He also reconstructed Kaiba to make him a semi-lead character and rival to Yugi.<ref name=\"bun 2 afterword\" />\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Kaiba Linework.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the [[Duelist]] in the outfit he wears in the [[Battle City]] arc from front, side, and rear views and alongside views of his head from different angles.]]\nKaiba's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]]. His usual outfit from the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|NAS anime]] consists of a long white sleeveless [[KaibaCorp]]-designed coat featuring shoulder pads and a raised studded collar, with black sleeves from his shirt coming out from under. He has extra belts in pairs strapped around his upper arms and shins. He often wears a [[KC mass production Disk|KaibaCorp Duel Disk]] on his left arm.\n\nIn his initial appearance and his first loss to [[Yami Yugi]], he wears a blue standard Domino High School uniform.\n\nDuring the events of the Duelist Kingdom, he wears a long indigo blue trenchcoat with a dark teal long sleeved button shirt with an extended collar, a matching pants with a white belt on his waist and black shoes. He later wears this outfit during the events of the Legendary Hero.\n\nBefore wearing his usual outfit and he was given the Obelisk The Tormentor by Ishizu Ishtar, his long trenchcoat becomes purple and his teal button shirt and pants are replaced with a black turtleneck and a matching pants and dons a steel wristbands in both of his wrist.\n\nIn the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei anime)|Toei anime]], Kaiba has green hair, while in the manga, Toei's ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' movie, and the NAS series, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters'', Kaiba has brown hair. Kaiba's character design in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'' anime is nearly identical to his original appearance, although his facial structure is changed subtly.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n===Personality===\nIn the original Japanese version of ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'', Kaiba omits honorifics and has a \"rude\" pattern of speech. Kaiba uses the word \"''ore''\" to mean \"I\" instead of ''boku ''or ''watashi''; ''ore'' is a boastful way to say \"I\" in Japanese. Kaiba usually calls Katsuya Jonouchi (Joey Wheeler) names, such as \"''bonkotsu''\" (mediocre), \"''make-inu''\" (pathetic dog, loser), \"''uma no hone''\" (a nobody), and \"''zako''\" (insignificant person, weakling). This name calling was carried over to the dub.\n\nIn the English version, Kaiba plays as an arch-rival to [[Yami Yugi]] and appears to have a certain snobbish contempt for Yugi's group of friends, namely [[Joey Wheeler]]; he refers to them constantly with derisive nicknames such as \"the nerd herd\", \"the dweeb patrol\", or \"the geek squad\". At one point, he kept running into them during ''Waking the Dragons'', and quipped \"Great. Dork fest continues.\" In the Japanese version, he is just civil towards them he does trust them at certain degree. He can be condescending, selfish, no-nonsense, and narcissistic, but, as [[Yami Yugi]] has said he can be oblivious at times. However, it is stated by Mokuba ever since being adopted by Gozaburo, Kaiba became much colder than he used to be. Despite this, Kaiba still has strong brotherly instincts for Mokuba and will put his life in danger in a heart beat to safeguard Mokuba's life.\n\nApart from Mokuba, Kaiba has compassion for children—especially orphans (as he himself was one and knew what it felt like). Kaiba also threw himself between Zorc and 2 Egyptian children, thus enabling them to make a getaway. At various points during the series, he opens up momentarily, performing kind acts, though always covering them up with sarcasm, and denying them if asked. These occurrences increase in frequency towards the later series. Aside from that, Kaiba maintains a conservative, stiff, and uptight exterior.\n\nAlthough Kaiba may seem very unkind toward his brother Mokuba, he has a brotherly love for him. When their adoptive brother Noah had hypnotized Mokuba into not remembering him and thinking Noah was his real brother, Kaiba revealed how much he cared about him to try to make him remember; in one Season 1 episode of the NAS anime, after Pegasus is defeated, Kaiba tells Yugi that Mokuba \"means everything to me\". This is shown when Kaiba risks his own life by standing on a ledge to win the Duel against Yugi so that he can get to Pegasus to save Mokuba. Even when Kaiba preaches that no one gets away with trying to take over his company, he risks KaibaCorp when Dueling Noah for Mokuba.\n\nKaiba has also had moments of selflessness, such as when he saved Téa from Marik's Rare Hunter without there being any incentive for him to do so. \n\nLike the Pharaoh, pride is Kaiba's strength and weakness; he never backs down from a fight and gives everything he can in a Duel. This results in his sense of superiority and sense of arrogance, making it extremely difficult to earn his respect, and causes him to look down on and treat others as inferior until they do so. This gives him difficulty when forced to rely on others and work as a team. His pride in himself and his accomplishments is a prominent part of his character throughout the series, and he reacts harshly to those who threaten or infringe on it (although it is toned down slightly towards the end).\n\nAlso, Kaiba dislikes other people using his cards, namely his \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" (his favorite and [[signature card]]; notably, he uses its motif to decorate a large portion of his personal effects - e.g., [[Kaiba Land]], his jet, and his clothing). This is shown in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 001]], when he rips up [[Solomon Muto]]'s Blue-Eyes White Dragon after winning it so that it could never be used against him, and also in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 136]] when Kaiba becomes very angry when he finds out about Joey using his \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" in their Duel. Kaiba goes so far as to attack Joey's \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" with his own, destroying both in the process, to prevent Joey from using it for another turn. (He even says angrily, \"I'm the only one with the skills necessary to wield a Blue-Eyes!\" while doing so.) He also despises Pegasus' \"[[Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon]]\", saying it strips the original of all its pride. According to [[Kazuki Takahashi|Takahashi]], Kaiba's obsession with the \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (character)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" stems from the feelings between [[Kisara]] (the girl whose Ka housed the Blue-Eyes) and his ancient Egyptian incarnate, [[Priest Seto]]. This may also be due to Kaiba's affinity for [[Dragon]]-Type monsters.<ref>''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' (bunkoban) Volume 21</ref> More likely than anything would be it having to do with wanting to have the strongest Deck possible out of any Duelist as part of his domination motif, as he went through great lengths to acquire the three copies he presently has.\n\nOne of Seto's recurring traits is his absolute refusal to believe in the magic powers that is often used in the series. Later on, during sagas like [[Waking the Dragons]], he openly admits to believing in all the supernatural events occurring around him, instead of just ignorantly saying they don't exist as he always does (although it is possible that he thinks that it's science instead of magic, and doesn't hesitate to do something about it). However, the closest in the dub that Kaiba has come to this is \"Maybe there is some truth to this junk\" in the final episodes; however, when questioned by Joey, he quickly denies having said such a thing. \n\nIn the Japanese version, while Kaiba does not take it very well, he is much more accepting of the faith and magic that occurs. In the Doma arc, he told Alister he should show him the power of a \"true Duelist\" and of the \"Chosen One\", and also openly accepted the vision he and Yami Yugi had after their Egyptian Gods were destroyed, as well as the fact that their battle was destined over the span of 3000 years. During the Duel against Dartz, Kaiba destroyed the \"[[Mirror Knight Token]]\" after they had taken the form of Yugi, Pegasus, Joey, and Mai because of his belief if they were true Duelists, they would be willing to allow themselves to be destroyed in order to save the world, while in the dub, Kaiba believed Dartz manipulated the holograms to resemble their friends in order to weaken their resolve. Although there are some instances where Kaiba is a believer in both the Japanese and dub. One such example would be during his final turn against [[Zigfried von Schroeder]] when he predicted he would draw exactly the spell cards he would need to defeat Zigfried, despite initially only having one card in his hand.\n\nUnderstandably, Kaiba gains a lot of contempt and disdain from virtually every single person he knows (with the exception of Mokuba) - mostly Joey, Tristan and Tea in particular. Yugi constantly holds out hope for him, as does Yugi's other self Yami. Though Yami himself finds Kaiba's attitude and arrogance quite infuriating. As was shown on the times they've been forced to Duel together as a team. Kaiba, for the most part, could not care less about what they think about him and returns the contempt in kind. \n\nIn the [[Dawn of the Duel|Memory World]] arc Kaiba's past self, [[Priest Seto]], is introduced. Priest Seto is depicted as being less antagonistic than modern-day Kaiba, and is portrayed as being very loyal with a strong sense of justice. However, he maintains Kaiba's pride and intelligent mind.\n\nKaiba, although generally self-centered and egotistic, he does have some morals in that he is against stealing. He has a vast belief that hard work and determination is what gets you ahead in life, not stealing from others to advance your situation. As such, he is disgusted by Zigfried and Noah, calling them pathetic and not worth living up to his company because they were planning on stealing his works to take his company instead of earning it through the hard work and determination he went through.\n\nKaiba also seems to take great pride in the Duel Disks he developed as he would use them even when Duel Rings are nearby by plugging it into the Duel Ring's hologram projector so any card he plays on his Duel Disk is displayed on the Duel Ring instead of just using the Duel Ring.\n\nDuring Battle City, Seto's main goal is defeating Yugi in a Duel. However, when he lost, he decided on a new path, rather an old one, of building Kaiba Land all around the world. However, he vowed his battle with Yugi is far from over, even though they never had an on-screen Duel after this.\n\nAt some point, Kaiba wanted to help young Duelists grow and bought [[Duel Academy]] to accomplish this goal.\n\n===Etymology===\nThe name \"Seto\" came from the Egyptian deity, [[wikipedia:Set (mythology)|Set]].<ref name=\"bun 2 afterword\">''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' (bunkoban) [[Yu-Gi-Oh! bunkoban - Volume 002|Volume 2]]: afterword</ref> In the Japanese and English versions, Kaiba is referred to by his last name by other characters, except for Mokuba.\n\n===Abilities===\nThroughout the series, Kaiba remains a formidable Duelist and businessman in his own right. In addition to his shrewd business acumen and gaming aptitude, Kaiba is skilled with science and technology. He specializes mainly in computer software programming and building cutting-edge technological software and hardware such as the development of KaibaCorp's high-tech Duel Disks and advanced Solid Vision technology.\n\n==Biography==\n===History===\n====Orphanage====\nAt a young age, Seto and his younger brother [[Mokuba Kaiba|Mokuba]]'s parents both died. Their relatives took everything from their will and sent Seto and Mokuba to the [[Kaiba brothers' orphanage|orphanage]]. (In the dub, it simply said that their parents died and there was no mention of their relatives).<ref name=\"ep 20\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|20|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx100 Seto and Mokuba play chess.jpg|thumb|right|Seto and Mokuba playing [[chess]] at the [[Kaiba brothers' orphanage|orphanage]]]]\nOn their first day at the orphanage, Seto comforted Mokuba, who was crying. He told him that he will be his father from there on and vowed to protect him no matter what. He advised Mokuba to always stay on his guard, as he will be finished if he shows any weakness.<ref name=\"ep 100\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|100|ref}}</ref>\n\nTogether at the orphanage, Seto and Mokuba would often play games, including [[chess]], which Seto always won, but still encouraged Mokuba.<ref name=\"ep 100\"/> When Mokuba was bullied by other kids, Seto would stick up for him and even jumped on another kid to retrieve a toy he stole from Mokuba.\n\nOne day they made a model theme park in the sandpit. Seto said that one day they would open real theme parks around the world, that everyone would want to visit<ref name=\"ep 143\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|143|ref}}</ref> and orphans would be allowed in free of charge.\n\nThe former head of KaibaCorp, [[Gozaburo Kaiba]], arrived at the orphanage to perform a publicity stunt. (In the English dub, Seto was twelve years old at the time.) Seto saw the chance to challenge him to a game of chess, with the stakes being that Gozaburo was to adopt Seto and Mokuba together, if Seto wins. Gozaburo refused at first, but when Seto threatened to tell everyone he backed down from a challenge with a child, he submits. Seto won since he had already studied Gozaburo's chess methods. Gozaburo then reluctantly adopted both brothers.<ref name=\"ep 100\"/>\n\n====Adoption====\n[[File:DMx103 Seto forced to study.jpg|thumb|left|Seto being forced to study. (The switchblade was removed in the dub.)]]\nWhen he adopted Seto, Gozaburo planned to only use his body as a shell for his son, [[Noah Kaiba|Noah]]. Noah had been injured in an accident and had his mind uploaded into a virtual world, as he was unable to survive in his real body. Gozaburo also wanted to use Seto to motivate Noah to work harder. However, Seto proved to be more capable of running KaibaCorp than Noah. Gozaburo abandoned his idea to transfer Noah's mind into Seto's body and focused his energies in training Seto. Gozaburo forced Seto into a rigorously accelerated education program.<ref name=\"ep 119\"/>\n\nWhen Gozaburo asked Seto what he planned to do with [[KaibaCorp]] after he inherited it, he said that he planned to build a [[Kaiba Land]] theme park for underprivileged children. Gozaburo called this boring, but Seto protested that games purify the soul. Gozaburo was not interested as games cannot be used to rule and ordered [[Hobson]] to confiscate all of Seto's toys, refusing to let Seto touch toys until he knew how to rule. (In the dub, Seto couldn't keep up with the pace Gozaburo wanted him to study at. Gozaburo disallowed him from having weekends off. As Gozaburo said that discipline is the only way to crush your enemies, Seto protested that he has no enemies. Gozaburo insisted that he does and he must learn that he can't even trust Gozaburo. He ordered Hobson to confiscate all of Seto's toys, so that they won't distract him from his studies.)<ref name=\"ep 103\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|103|ref}}</ref>\n\nMokuba hid Seto's ''[[Duel Monsters]]'' Deck in a hollowed-out book, including a [[Mokuba's \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" drawing|drawing]] of a \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\". He also left a note saying that their new family couldn't take everything away from them. Kaiba stepped out onto a balcony and vowed to get a real \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", one day.<ref name=\"ep 103\"/> Seto \n\n[[File:DMx190 Young Seto and Zigfried meet.jpg|thumb|right|Seto meets [[Zigfried von Schroeder|Zigfried]].]]\nGozaburo brought Seto and Mokuba to a party he threw. Seto had achieved a name for himself as a prodigy. A German man introduced his son as a prodigy too. His son, [[Zigfried von Schroeder]], whispered to Seto asking if they should spice things up. Then the lights began to flicker on and off. Gozaburo was astonished as the system was protected by a fail safe system. Zigfried whispered to Kaiba that he dabbles in technology. He said that spending all your time alone causes you to tinker in your own projects and that Seto must understand.<ref name=\"ep 190\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|190|ref}}</ref>\n\nOn Seto's birthday, he was given a 2% share of KaibaCorp (in the dub, 10 million dollars) and was told that although he could spend the money any way he wished, he must return one hundred times (in the dub, 10 times) the amount in one year. Seto returned all the money within a single day. He did this by buying 51% shares of a small company that cares for its employees, Seto then made the president buy it back, under threat of it being shut down and leaving the employees jobless.<ref name=\"ep 108\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|108|ref}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n====KaibaCorp take-over====\nSeto invented a virtual software for playing video games. However, Gozaburo intended to use it for war. Seto confronted him over this, but Gozaburo scolded him again for wanting to play games. Seto was to inherit the company one day, Gozaburo said, and the company is about beating enemies and rising to power, not making toys. Seto called him insane and Gozaburo had his guards take Seto away. Seto called out \"Father\" as he was dragged away. That was the last time he called Gozaburo \"Father\".<ref name=\"ep 104\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|104|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx109 Seto against Mokuba.jpg|thumb|left|Seto turns Mokuba against him.]]\nNot wanting his virtual system to be used by Gozaburo to kill countless people and make a fortune, Seto refused to let himself hand his system over to the evil man. He lost his respect for Gozaburo, and decided that he would take over [[KaibaCorp]].<ref name=\"ep 104\"/>\n\nSeto made a deal with [[The Big Five]], where they would try to overthrow Gozaburo. He told the Big Five that Gozaburo didn't give them the respect they deserved and he would treat them better once he becomes in charge.<ref name=\"ep 109\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|109|ref}}</ref>\n\nTogether they gained 49% of KaibaCorp leaving Gozaburo with 49% and Mokuba 2%. Seto made sure Gozaburo came to know of their plan and accused Mokuba of snitching on them. Seto and Mokuba were briefly turned against each other and Mokuba was given comfort by Gozaburo. Aware of Seto's plan, Gozaburo planned to use his remaining 49% with Mokuba's 2% to overrule Seto. However, Seto had planned a step ahead knowing how Mokuba was very supportive of Seto's dream to turn KaibaCorp into a gaming company compared to being a weapons manufacturing plant and as expected, Mokuba switched back to his side one last minute, giving Seto his 2%. With the 51%, Seto was able to take full control of the company. Unable to live with the defeat, Gozaburo committed suicide,<ref name=\"ep 109\"/> but not before he uploaded his mind into [[Noah Kaiba|Noah]]'s virtual world (in the dub, Gozaburo left in disgrace after the takeover, never to be seen or heard from again until the Virtual World arc).<ref name=\"ep 119\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|119|ref}}</ref>\n\n====Refocusing KaibaCorp====\nAfter taking control of KaibaCorp, Seto shifted its economic interest from manufacturing weapons of mass destruction to game-oriented equipment.\n\nKaiba didn't give [[The Big Five]] the respect or power they had been expecting when they made the deal to overthrow Gozaburo. He refused to provide finance to [[Crump]] to build his dream penguin theme park.<ref name=\"ep 102\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|102|ref}}</ref> He told [[Nezbitt]] to show his loyalty by destroying the military factory on [[Alcatraz]].<ref name=\"ep 106\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|106|ref}}</ref> Once that was done, Kaiba closed the military department and proceeded to build the Duel Tower in its place. He demoted Nezbitt to dispatching material for building the tower.<ref name=\"ep 107\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|107|ref}}</ref> In the dub, it's also stated that Kaiba demoted [[Leichter]] from heir to the company president to a figurehead.<ref name=\"ep 109\" />\n\nKaiba started building an amusement park for orphaned and underprivileged children called [[Kaiba Land]]. At the start of the series, only one Kaiba Land had been built, in Domino (in the dub, none of the parks had been built, and Kaiba Land was touted as the KaibaCorp headquarters).\n\nKaiba began work on creating holographic technology to heighten the experience of playing ''Duel Monsters''.\n\n[[File:DMx194 Solid Vision demo.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba demonstrates the [[Solid Vision|holographic technology]] and makes a partnership with [[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]].]]\n[[Maximillion Pegasus]] invited Kaiba as his special guest to the [[Intercontinental Duel Monsters Tournament]] in New York City. Kaiba witnesses Pegasus face [[Bandit Keith]] in the finals. At the Duel, Pegasus simply sat in front of Keith for a few seconds, then wrote down some instructions on a piece of paper, which he gave to a beginner, [[Sam]], from the audience to use against Keith. While Sam Dueled Keith, Pegasus sat with Kaiba. He hoped Kaiba was \"enjoying the tournament so far, even though it must seem so crude to him, unlike the holographic Dueling stations KaibaCorp is developing.\"<ref name=\"ep 16\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|16|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba met with Pegasus to demonstrate a miniature [[Dueling Arena]] to a group of businessmen. [[Zigfried von Schroeder]] then entered the room disgusted, as he had developed [[Battle Box|something similar]] and believed Kaiba's idea belonged to him.<ref name=\"ep 194\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|194|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba inferred that Pegasus must have read Keith's mind in the Duel, so later he began making [[Duel Disk]]s to combat Pegasus' mind reading strategy. With Duel Disks, players would be able to stand further apart and avoid face-to-face contact, which he hoped would be enough to avoid having his mind read.<ref name=\"ep 16\"/>\n\n===Yu-Gi-Oh!===\n====Duelist Kingdom====\nKaiba became the [[Duel Monsters World Champion]] and came into possession of three of the four \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" cards (In the Japanese version, the latter didn't happen until after Kaiba tried to obtain Solomon's \"Blue-Eyes\").<ref name=\"ep 1\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|1|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rip.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba rips Solomon's \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\".]]\nAt school, Kaiba overheard [[Yugi Muto]] talking about a rare card his grandfather, [[Solomon Muto]] has. Suspecting it might be the 4th \"Blue-Eyes\", Kaiba visited [[Kame Game|Solomon's shop]] and saw the card. He tried to trade for the card and buy it, but Solomon refused, since the card is of high sentimental value to him. Still determined and sickened by Solomon's attitude, Kaiba kidnapped him and challenged him to a Duel. Kaiba defeated Solomon and overwhelmed him with the [[Solid Vision|holographic technology]] used in the Duel. As a prize, he took Solomon's \"Blue-Eyes\". He then called Yugi over to collect his grandfather. Shortly after Yugi arrived, Kaiba tore-up the \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" card in front of him and his friends. Outraged, Yugi Dueled Kaiba as [[Yami Yugi]]. Yami is put in a tight place after Kaiba Summons all 3 \"Blue-Eyes White Dragons\", but managed to win by Summoning \"[[Exodia]]\". After winning, Yami inflicted a [[Penalty Game|Mind Crush]] on Kaiba dispelling [[Impersonator of Death|his evil half]].<ref name=\"ep 1\"/> In the Japanese anime, the Mind Crush simply destroyed the evil in Kaiba so he can start over.\n\nAfter his defeat, Kaiba dropped out of playing ''Duel Monsters'' as a result of being confused about how power lost to heart and began rebuilding himself.<ref name=\"ep 8\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|8|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx008 Jump out the window.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba jumps out the window.]]\n[[Maximillion Pegasus]] formed an alliance with [[The Big Five]] to try to take-over [[KaibaCorp]]. They sent two men to Kaiba's office to capture him. Kaiba refused to cooperate, so the henchmen prepared to open fire. However, Kaiba knocked them back with a chair and deflected their gunshots with his briefcase. He jumped out the window of his office, leading them to believe he died. (In the dub, the guns are removed and Kaiba jumped out after refusing to cooperate.)<ref name=\"ep 8\"/> However Kaiba clung onto the side of the cliff and climbed to his safety. In the meantime his Deck was stolen and Mokuba was kidnapped.<ref name=\"ep 9\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|9|ref}}</ref>\n\nLater Kaiba snuck back into his mansion through a hidden passageway. He entered a hidden computer lab, where he got an update on what Pegasus had done to KaibaCorp. He learned that Mokuba was held prisoner on the [[Duelist Kingdom (island)|Duelist Kingdom island]] and Pegasus will be given shares of KaibaCorp once Yugi is defeated in the [[Duelist Kingdom|Duelist Kingdom tournament]]. Kaiba hacked into Pegasus' computer system and found Yugi was Dueling an impostor Seto Kaiba, the [[Impersonator of Death]], who even had the real Kaiba's Deck.<ref name=\"ep 9\"/> Kaiba infected a \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" Summoned by the impersonator with a virus, weakening it and consequently preventing Yugi from losing the Duel.<ref name=\"ep 10\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|10|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba flew to the Duelist Kingdom to confront Pegasus. He brought his [[Duel Disk]]s with him to combat Pegasus' mind reading.<ref name=\"ep 16\"/>\n\nAs soon as he arrived on the island, he bumped into Yugi and his friends. Yugi returned Kaiba's Deck to him and suggested that they stick together as they are all going to Pegasus' castle, but Kaiba declined. [[Joey Wheeler]], who was disgusted by Kaiba's attitude, confronted him, and the two wound-up Dueling. Kaiba used the Duel as a chance to test his Duel Disks. Joey foolishly attacked Kaiba's monsters with a barrage of weaker ones, until he Summoned his \"[[Red-Eyes B. Dragon (anime)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]\", which Kaiba defeated with \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" and took out the remainder of Joey's Life Points. Kaiba cruelly mocked Joey and called him a loser. Before leaving, he told the group about Pegasus' Duel with Keith, so Yugi and Joey know what they are up against.<ref name=\"ep 16\"/>\n\n[[File:DMx020 Jammed gun.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba jams [[Kemo|Kemo's]] gun. (This scene was removed in the dub)]]\nThe next day, [[Kemo]] found Kaiba on the island and pointed a gun to his head. However Kaiba jammed the gun with a \"[[Gyakutenno Megami (anime)|Gyakutenno Megami]]\" card. Kaiba pulled the gun from Kemo, injuring his hand. (This scene is removed from the dub.) Kemo lunged at Kaiba, but Kaiba subdued him and ordered him to take them to Mokuba. Kemo took Kaiba to Pegasus' dungeons, but triggered a security alarm, calling for backup.<ref name=\"ep 20\"/> Pegasus, who had already known this would happen insisted they turn off the alarm and goes to the dungeons to meet Kaiba himself.\n\nKaiba hid on one of the walls and listened-in on a group of Pegasus' guards, who had been unable to find him. The guards decided to go to Mokuba's cell, believing Kaiba will show up there soon. Kaiba leaped down and followed them. Once they arrived at the cell, Kaiba sneaked-up on them and knocked them out. Kaiba was briefly reunited with Mokuba, but was confronted by Pegasus before he could release him. Pegasus used the [[Millennium Eye]] to strip Mokuba of his soul, which he trapped in a \"[[Soul Prison]]\" card. Pegasus said that Kaiba must defeat him in a Duel if he wished to free Mokuba. Kaiba was willing to Duel on the spot, but Pegasus refused telling Kaiba that he must defeat Yugi in a Duel, before he can do that.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|21|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx024 Plan B.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba stands on the edge of the castle, risking his life to win.]]\nKaiba confronted Yugi outside the castle and imposed a Duel. Initially Yugi refuses, but he switched to Yami Yugi and accepted.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|22|ref}}</ref> During the Duel, Kaiba Summoned \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\", causing problems for Yami,<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|23|ref}}</ref> but Yami fused it with \"[[Mammoth Graveyard (anime)|Mammoth Graveyard]]\", causing it to decay and lose [[ATK]] each turn. Kaiba sees Mokuba, begging Seto to help him. A younger version of Seto tries to run to Mokuba's aid but unfortunately, is to late. Kaiba refuses to lose his only chance at saving his brother. As Yami was about to win, Kaiba stood-up on the edge of the castle, such that if Yami made another attack, he would fall to his death. Although Yami tried to attack, Yugi took-over and called it off. Kaiba won on the next turn, taking five of Yugi's [[Star Chips]]. Combined with the five Pegasus gave him earlier, Kaiba had enough to enter the castle and face Pegasus.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|24|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba got ready to Duel Pegasus. He insisted on using the Duel Disks, but Pegasus wasn't too keen. Pegasus accepted under the condition, that Mokuba who is stripped of his soul, held the Duel Disk for him. Kaiba refused to face his brother in such a way and agreed to Duel without the Disks.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|26|ref}}</ref> Pegasus defeated Kaiba while using his Millennium Eye. Kaiba privately asked Mokuba to forgive him as Pegasus trapped his soul in another \"Soul Prison\" card.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|27|ref}}</ref>\n\nWhen Yugi defeated Pegasus, as promised Pegasus freed the souls of Seto and Mokuba Kaiba, along with Solomon Muto.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|40|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba thanked Yugi for saving Mokuba and insisted that they should have a fair Duel someday to determine who is the better Duelist. He gave Yugi and his friends a lift home from the island afterwards.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|41|ref}}</ref>\n\n====Legendary Heroes====\nKaiba prepared to fire [[The Big Five]] for trying to take over KaibaCorp, as well as payment for the suffering through which they had forced him and Mokuba. But the Big Five plead with Kaiba, and gave him the complete virtual reality game as a peace offering. Eager to try out the virtual reality game, Kaiba refrained from immediately firing them and decided to test the system. Mokuba advised against it, harboring doubt. Kaiba however assured him otherwise, and continued to experiment with the game.<ref name=\"ep 43\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|43|ref}}</ref>\n\nInside the game, Kaiba was confronted by a [[Two-Headed King Rex (anime)|Two-Headed King Rex]], which he easily defeated by Summoning \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\". However an [[Armed Ninja (anime)|Armed Ninja]] ambushed him, taking him by surprise as he had no recollection of programming it. Kaiba attempted to attack it with Blue-Eyes, but a [[Dragon Capture Jar (anime)|Dragon Capture Jar]] appeared and trapped the dragon. The Armed Ninja threw a net on Kaiba, capturing him.<ref name=\"ep 43\"/>\n\n[[File:DMx044 Captive Kaiba.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba held captive.]]\nKaiba was taken to the [[Castle of Dark Illusions (location)|Castle of Dark Illusions]]\" and chained to a pillar, where he is held captive by the [[Witty Phantom (character)|Witty Phantom]]. Witty Phantom told Kaiba that he is to be sacrificed to Summon the [[Five-Headed Dragon (character)|Mythic Dragon]]. In an attempt to escape, Kaiba tried to end the simulation, but learned that that function had been disabled.<ref name=\"ep 44\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|44|ref}}</ref>\n\nMokuba recruited Yugi and Joey to help him in his efforts to rescue Kaiba. Together they go to the castle and Mokuba managed to free Kaiba. Kaiba Summoned a second \"Blue-Eyes\", which destroyed the phantom. He re-encounters Armed Ninja and the Dragon Capture Jar, but destroyed the jar with \"[[Trap Master (anime)|Trap Master]]\" reclaiming his trapped \"Blue-Eyes\". The two \"Blue-Eyes\" easily defeated Armed Ninja.<ref name=\"ep 45\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|45|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba had \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" blast a hole in the floor, allowing him and Mokuba to meet-up with Yugi, Joey and Mai. The Big Five congratulated the players on making it to the final level, but Kaiba protested that they stopped the \"Mythic Dragon\" from being Summoned, so they have already beaten the game. However the Big Five had reprogrammed the game making them have to face the \"Mythic Dragon\".<ref name=\"ep 45\"/>\n\nThe group were sent to a room, where only Dragon-Type monsters are of use. The group had their dragons attack the \"Mythic Dragon\" to no avail. The Mythic Dragon started to take out the players and their dragons one by one. Mokuba pushed Kaiba out of the way of one of its blasts, saving Kaiba, but letting himself be taken out. With the loss of Mokuba taking a great toll on Kaiba, Yugi's persuasion finally got through to Kaiba, who fused his dragons into \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\". Yugi then fuses it with \"[[Black Luster Soldier (anime)|Black Luster Soldier]]\" to form \"[[Dragon Master Knight (anime)|Dragon Master Knight]]\", which defeated the \"Mythic Dragon\".<ref name=\"ep 45\"/>\n\nKaiba and Yugi woke-up in the courtyard of the [[Princess Adena|Edina]]'s palace. The crowds cheered for them for defeating the \"Mythic Dragon\". Edina turned into Mystical Elf and revived Joey, Mai, Mokuba and [[Iru]].<ref name=\"ep 45\"/>\n\nKaiba and his rescuers returned to the real world,<ref name=\"ep 45\"/> while the Big Five were left trapped in the virtual world.\n\n====Battle City====\n[[File:DMx052 Kaiba gets Obelisk.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba receives \"[[Obelisk the Tormentor (anime)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]\".]]\n\n[[Ishizu Ishtar]] invited Kaiba to an Ancient Egypt exhibition. Here she used her [[Millennium Necklace]] to show him visions from the past, where [[Priest Seto|a sorcerer]], who looks like Kaiba, battled the [[Pharaoh Atem|Nameless Pharaoh]], who looks like Yugi, using [[Duel Monster Spirits]]. She told him about their most powerful monsters, the [[Egyptian Gods]], which [[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]] made ''Duel Monsters'' cards of, but was unable to control their power. She had come into possession of one of the Gods, \"[[Obelisk the Tormentor (anime)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]\", while the others were stolen by thieves. She gave Kaiba the card, in exchange for him starting a ''Duel Monsters'' tournament to attract the thieves so they may gather the three Gods. Kaiba laughed at the idea of him returning the \"Obelisk\" card, but Ishizu insisted that he will, as she has foreseen it. Kaiba agreed to host the tournament in the hopes of gathering the three God cards for himself through an [[Ante Duel|ante rule]]<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|52|ref}}</ref> and so he can defeat Yugi, reclaiming his title as World Champion.\n\nKaiba tested \"Obelisk\", by Dueling a [[Duel Computer]], which was using his [[Duelist Kingdom]] Deck. The computer Summoned \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\", but Kaiba defeated it with \"Obelisk the Tormentor\", whose strength proved too much for the computer, causing it to catch fire.<ref name=\"ep 54\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|54|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba invited Duelists he thought to be good enough to participate in the tournament. All players were given the newest version of his [[Duel Disk]]s.<ref name=\"ep 54\"/> The [[Rare Hunters]], who were not invited, hacked into his computer system to add themselves as participants. Mokuba suggested that they disqualify them, but Kaiba allowed for it. (In the dub, Kaiba had planned to have them hack in all along, so the holders of the Egyptian Gods would enter the tournament.)<ref name=\"ep 56\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|56|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Seeker|first Rare Hunter]] Dueled Yugi. Kaiba found out the Rare Hunter was using fake cards, but still didn't disqualify him, as he needed to learn more about the Rare Hunters.<ref name=\"ep 56\"/>\n\nKaiba took part in the tournament himself, leaving his employees monitor other Duels to find the Egyptian God cards.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|57|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba found [[Koji \"the Spider\" Nagumo|Koji Nagumo]] bullying a Duelist he just defeated into giving him a second card through the ante rule. Kaiba challenged Koji to a Duel and gave him rare cards to improve his Deck beforehand. Despite this, Kaiba quickly defeated him using \"Obelisk the Tormentor\".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|60|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx066 Kaiba encourages Yugi.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba encourages Yugi in his Duel against [[Strings]].]]\nHe spent much of the preliminaries trying to find and defeat Yugi. He bumped into [[Joey Wheeler]] in his search, surprised to see him wearing a Duel Disk as he hadn't been invited. Joey challenged Kaiba to a Duel on the spot, but Kaiba received word of a God Card being played and took-off. He found Yugi in a Duel against [[Strings]], who was possessed by [[Marik Ishtar]] and using the Egyptian God card \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\". Seeing Yugi drops to his knees, doubting he can win, Kaiba called down to him, ordering him live up to his reputation and thinking he is the only one who should defeat Yugi.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|66|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter Yugi won, Kaiba congratulated him, but said it's a shame Yugi won't have \"Slifer the Sky Dragon\" for long and challenged him to a Duel. However Marik informed Yugi that his friends had been kidnapped. Yugi postponed the Duel as he must find his friends.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|67|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba followed Yugi and caught-up when Yugi was challenged to a Duel by two Rare Hunters, who couldn't decide which of them should face Yugi first. Kaiba appeared and told them to both Duel at once in a Tag Duel against him and Yugi. They agree and Kaiba easily defeated both of them at once using \"Obelisk the Tormentor\". Kaiba took their [[Locator Card]]s and handed one to Yugi. He then offered to use KaibaCorp's satellite system to trace the location of Joey's Duel Disk.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|68|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx070 Tag Duel.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba and Yugi Tag Duel against [[Umbra]] and [[Lumis]] on the skyscraper.]]\nAs they searched for Yugi's friends, the guys were confronted by [[Lumis]], who showed them that they have kidnapped Mokuba. In order to get Mokuba back, Yugi and Kaiba had to Tag Duel him and [[Umbra]] on top of a skyscraper. The Duel was setup such that when a player loses, the glass roof below them shatters sending them to their death (in the dub, there was a vortex to the [[Shadow Realm]] under the glass).<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|70|ref}}</ref> Kaiba's refusal to work as part of a team, initially hindered his and Yugi's performance, while Umbra and Lumis' Decks had been built to work together and prevent the Summoning of the [[Egyptian God]]s. However Kaiba eventually accepted that they must work as a team.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|71|ref}}</ref> He sacrificed his \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" to prevent Yugi from losing and provoked Umbra and Lumis turning them against each other. Yugi and Kaiba worked together to Summon \"Obelisk the Tormentor\", which defeated Umbra, who used a parachute to save himself. [[Marik Ishtar|Marik]] took control of Lumis' mind after he surrendered. Kaiba seized him demanding they release Mokuba. However Marik didn't keep his promise and left Lumis fall unconscious.<ref name=\"ep 73\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|73|ref}}</ref> Kaiba took \"[[Masked Beast Des Gardius (anime)|Masked Beast Des Gardius]]\"<ref name=\"ep 122\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|122|ref}}</ref> and the locator cards from Lumis. He handed Yugi one of the Locator Cards, qualifying them both for the finals.<ref name=\"ep 73\"/>\n\nDespite Marik's refusal to keep his end of the bargain, Mokuba arrived on the top of the skyscraper in the KaibaCorp helicopter, having escaped captivity with [[Téa Gardner|Téa's]] help. To repay Yugi's friends for saving Mokuba, Kaiba took Yugi to find his friends, having tracked the signal from Joey's Duel Disk.<ref name=\"ep 73\"/> On the helicopter, [[Yami Yugi]] told Kaiba that he is a separate personality from [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]].<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|74|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx078 Card Shurikenjutsu.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba throws the card at the Rare Hunter.]]\nThey arrived at the [[Domino Pier]] and find Joey and Téa are possessed by Marik, with Joey prepared to Duel Yugi. Seeing the Duel had been set-up to kill the loser, Kaiba tried to call it off, but Marik disregarded his authority.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|75|ref}}</ref> Once [[Tristan Taylor|Tristan]] and [[Duke Devlin|Duke]] arrived at the Duel, Kaiba and Mokuba explained the situation to them.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|77|ref}}</ref> Towards the end of the Duel, Kaiba threw a card at one of the Rare Hunters monitoring the Duel. The card got lodged into his hand, causing him to drop the controls for a crane hovering a giant crate over Téa. With him temporarily unable to drop the crate, the KaibaCorp helicopter pulled it away from Téa. Once the Duel concluded with everyone alive, Kaiba parted and told Yugi that he'll see him at the finals.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|78|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba took his helicopter to the [[KaibaCorp Stadium]], where he waited for the other finalists. After six of the other seven finalists arrived, the true location of the finals, the [[Kaiba Craft 3]] landed. Kaiba's men tried to prevent Yugi and Joey's friends from boarding as they were not finalists, but Kaiba nonchalantly allowed it. On board Kaiba insulted Joey about making it this far by luck and advised Yugi to start using \"Slifer\".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|79|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[Bakura Ryou]] was greatly injured after his Duel with Yugi. His friends tried talking Kaiba into making an emergency stop to take him to the hospital, but Kaiba refused until Serenity begged for him to show some compassion. He still tried to remain cold, but let Bakura have some medical attention anyway.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|85|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba saw Joey's quarter-final Duel against [[Odion Ishtar|Odion]], who they believed to be Marik, as a chance to find out the abilities of his Egyptian God, \"[[The Winged Dragon of Ra (anime)|The Winged Dragon of Ra]]\".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|86|ref}}</ref> During the Duel, both players were struck down by Ra's lightning. Kaiba declared that the first player to stand up will be the winner and if neither stand within five minutes they will both be disqualified. He learned that Marik was also a finalist under the disguise \"Namu\" and while Odion had a fake \"The Winged Dragon of Ra\", Marik held the real one.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|89|ref}}</ref> He refused to disqualify Marik as he won't be able to win his God Card in that case.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|90|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[Mai Valentine|Mai]]'s Duel against the real Marik was also used as a chance to learn more about \"The Winged Dragon of Ra\". When Mai tried Summoning Ra, which she managed to add to her own hand, hieratic text appeared on the card, which Mai needed to recite in order to Summon it. Kaiba had his satellites photograph the card, so he can have the text translated later, although Marik suggested that Kaiba is already able to read them.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|92|ref}}</ref>\n\nOnce Mokuba began the translation, he found that some of Ra's effects are also printed there.\n\n[[File:DMx094 Kaiba's tablet vision.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba, shortly before the vision of [[Priest Seto]] holding [[Kisara]] up to the \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (character)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" tablet.]]\nIn the last of the quarterfinals Kaiba found out the eight finalist is [[Ishizu Ishtar]], as the two of them Dueled. In the meantime, Kaiba had Mokuba work on translating Ra's text. Ishizu had already predicted Kaiba's moves for the Duel using her [[Millennium Necklace]] and foresaw her own victory.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|93|ref}}</ref> In the first few turns of the Duel, Kaiba had Ishizu send plenty of cards from her [[Main Deck|Deck]] to her [[Graveyard]]. Ishizu used \"[[Exchange of the Spirit (anime)|Exchange of the Spirit]]\", causing both players to swap the contents of their Decks with their Graveyards, leaving Kaiba with very few cards. Almost finished the translation, Mokuba came out to support Seto in the Duel. Ishizu deliberately allowed Kaiba to Summon \"Obelisk the Tormentor\", so that she may win using \"[[Sacrifice's Blast]]\", as predicted. However Kaiba was affected by the [[Millennium Rod]] and felt \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (character)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" calling out to him, feeling it wanted him to Summon it. Kaiba saw a vision of [[Priest Seto|the sorcerer]] holding [[Kisara]]'s body up to a \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" tablet. Kaiba followed the instinct, claiming he makes his own future and [[Tribute]]d \"Obelisk the Tormentor\" to play \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", which he used to attack and defeat Ishizu.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|94|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba checked on the progress in translating \"The Winged Dragon of Ra's\" text. Mokuba told him that they're having trouble with the last few words, but Kaiba looked at the text in astonishment, finding that he's able to read it himself. Remembering what Marik said about only chosen people being able to read the text, what Ishizu said about him being connected to an ancient sorcerer and the instinct that told him to play \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" in the last Duel, Kaiba wondered what was happening to him.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|95|ref}}</ref>\n\n====Virtual World====\n[[File:DMx098 Virtual claw.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba lets himself get struck by the virtual dinosaur.]]\n\nWhile traveling to the finals, the Battle City blimp went out of control and was guided into a mechanical fortress in the sea by [[Noah Kaiba|Noah]]. Kaiba, Mokuba, Yugi, Joey, Tristan, Téa, Serenity and Duke were greeted by a projection of [[the Big Five]], who explained that they got trapped in the [[Noah's Virtual World|Virtual World]] after they failed to trap Kaiba there during the [[#Legendary Heroes|Legendary Heroes]] game. For that they hate Yugi and his friends for helping Kaiba. Having Kaiba as a common enemy, Noah uploaded their minds into his computer system. Using an altered form of ''Duel Monsters'', they planned to face the gang in order to claim possession of their bodies, so that they may exist in the real world.<ref name=\"ep 98\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|98|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe group were then transported to a virtual jungle. Kaiba wasn't fooled into thinking the place was real and allowed himself to be struck by a dinosaur, whose claw simply passed through Kaiba, leaving him unharmed. A virtual copy of Kaiba appeared and Duels a \"[[Total Defense Shogun (anime)|Total Defense Shogun]]\" in a demonstration of the [[Deck Master]] rules, used in this virtual world.<ref name=\"ep 98\"/> The Big Five separated the gang, by making holes appear under them.<ref name=\"ep 99\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|99|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx100 Past and present Seto and Mokuba.jpg|thumb|right|Seto and Mokuba see their past selves as they are made to witness many of their memories.]]\nSeto and Mokuba ended up together in a forest. The two of them came to a door, which transported them to a virtual reconstruction of the orphanage that they used to live in.<ref name=\"ep 99\"/> Here, they were shown projections of their past, including when they got sent to the orphanage and when they got adopted. Mokuba ran away from Seto over to the door, telling Seto that he had liked things the way they were before they got adopted; at least back then, Mokuba said, Seto actually smiled once in a while. Seto reminded him that they can't change the past and assured him that it's just an illusion created by Noah. However Mokuba opened the door, causing him to slip over the side of a cliff. Seto reached in on time, catching Mokuba's arm before he fell any further.<ref name=\"ep 100\"/> Seto pulled him up and the two found themselves on top of the cliff. The virtual world Seto designed had safeguards to prevent such harm befalling on people, but this place, they realized, is different. Seto told Mokuba that no matter what they see, he must realize that the past is over. He said that he is not proud of every decision he has made, but they were all made in favor of getting the two of them a better life.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|101|ref}}</ref>\n\nSeto and Mokuba made their way to a log cabin in a forest. Inside they witnessed projections of when they started living with Gozaburo, including Seto being forced to study and having his toys confiscated. The projection faded away and Noah appeared before Seto and Mokuba. Seto asked Noah why he's making them watch this stuff. Noah replied that it's to refresh Seto's memory of how he forced Gozaburo to a dead end and one day Seto shall be punished.<ref name=\"ep 103\"/>\n\nShortly afterwards, Noah sent them to another recreation of Seto's past, where he argued with Gozaburo over the use the virtual software that Seto had invented. Present day Seto accused Noah of using the virtual software that Gozaburo stole from him.<ref name=\"ep 104\"/>\n\nSeto and Mokuba were then sent to a beach, where they found a TV half-buried. In it they saw Joey's Duel with [[Johnson]] and Noah telling Johnson off for cheating.<ref name=\"ep 105\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|105|ref}}</ref>\n\nHaving lived in Seto's shadow, Noah needed to prove that he is more deserving of the position of president of KaibaCorp and cannot do that through cheating. Seto wondered why Noah is putting the two of them in competition. Seto suspected, but can't believe it's to do with Gozaburo, since he is dead. Kaiba started to wonder who Noah really is.<ref name=\"ep 105\" />\n\nKaiba and Mokuba traveled through a desert, where they saw the ruins of KaibaCorp's old military center.<ref name=\"ep 107\"/>\n\n[[File:DMx108 Kaiba vs Fake Tristan.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba faces [[Nezbitt]], who is inside [[Tristan Taylor|Tristan's]] body.]]\nThe two finally made their way to a city. Here, Nezbitt, inside [[Tristan Taylor|Tristan]]'s body, attacked them with a kendo stick. Kaiba tried throwing a card at Nezbitt, but he blocked. He then grabbed a pipe, which Nezbitt easily knocked out of his hand. The real Tristan, in the body of a robot monkey, jumped at the impostor, saving Kaiba. Yugi and his friends arrived and caught the action. Joey punched Nezbitt, smashing him through a warehouse door. However Nezbitt emerged on a motorbike and snatched Mokuba, before driving off. Kaiba grabbed another motorbike and took off after Nezbitt.<ref name=\"ep 108\"/>\n\nThe chase led Kaiba to a bridge, where he was stopped by [[Leichter]]. Leichter had taken the form of [[Jinzo]], but this was hidden by his trenchcoat. In order to get Mokuba back, Kaiba had to first defeat Leichter in a Duel. Kaiba was given access to ''Duel Monster'' cards, bar the Egyptian Gods to build his Deck. Kaiba choose \"[[Lord of D. (anime)|Lord of Dragons]]\" as his [[Deck Master]]. He was initially unable to see Leichter's Deck Master, nor does he care, until one of his [[Trap Card]]s was destroyed, revealing Jinzo to be the Deck Master.<ref name=\"ep 108\"/> During the Duel, Leichter taunted Kaiba about using the Big Five and Mokuba in order to overthrow Gozaburo. Leichter's Deck was weapon-themed and Kaiba had worked to remove such aspects from KaibaCorp. Refusing to lose his dream to a weapon of death, Kaiba Summoned \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\", which took out Leichter's \"[[Satellite Cannon (anime)|Satellite Cannon]]\", before it could launch an attack, winning the Duel for Kaiba.<ref name=\"ep 109\" />\n\n[[File:Kaiba and Lord of Dragons.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba and his Deck Master, \"[[Lord of D. (anime)|Lord of Dragons]]\" during his Duel with [[Leichter]].]]\nAfter the Duel, Noah formed a tunnel and told Kaiba that he must come this way to find Mokuba. Inside he found Noah, disguised as Mokuba, who transported Kaiba to a living room, containing the real Mokuba. Noah insisted that it was Kaiba's former employee that kidnapped Mokuba and that he was the one who rescued him. Kaiba tried to leave with Mokuba. However Mokuba had been brainwashed against him by Noah.<ref name=\"ep 110\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|110|ref}}</ref>\n\nYugi and Téa arrived and showed Kaiba a picture of Noah with Gozaburo. Noah showed Seto a clip from is own past. There Gozaburo was shown speaking with Noah, he handed him a picture of Seto, saying that he planned to bring Seto here to challenge Noah academically and prove Noah had the intelligence to run KaibaCorp. Noah agreed and called Gozaburo father. Kaiba refused to believe Noah was Gozaburo's son and asked how come they never met before.<ref name=\"ep 110\" />\n\nBefore Noah could answer, an alarm sounded causing him to leave. Kaiba, Téa and Yugi wound up with the rest of Yugi's friends, while Noah took the Big Five away to tell them off for trying to steal bodies having not won their Duels.<ref name=\"ep 110\" />\n\nAs Yugi's friends asked Kaiba about Noah and saving Mokuba, he told them to mind their own business and redirected their attention to The Big Five, who are now sharing Tristan's body.<ref name=\"ep 111\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|111|ref}}</ref>\n\nWhile Yugi and his friends were distracted, Kaiba searched for Mokuba by himself. At the top of a hill, he started calling for Mokuba. Although Mokuba heard him, he refused to answer, accepting Noah as his only brother. The clouds in front of Kaiba disappeared, revealing a [[Kaiba Land]]. (In the dub that Kaiba Land had not been built, nor had Kaiba shown anyone its blueprints.)<ref name=\"ep 111\" />\n\nInside Kaiba Land, Seto was shown a video with footage of young Noah, spending time with Gozaburo and Noah's funeral, in which Gozaburo said that Noah can still be saved.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|112|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kaiba and Kaiser Sea Horse.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba and his Deck Master, \"[[Kaiser Sea Horse (anime)|Kaiser Sea Horse]]\" during his Duel with [[Noah Kaiba|Noah]].]]\nKaiba took a train from Kaiba Land to a volcanic area, where he met Noah. Noah explained how he had his consciousness uploaded into the virtual world shortly after the accident, where he nearly died (in the dub, it is only referred to as an \"accident\", and Noah says \"It is not important what happened to me\"). By beating Seto in a Duel, Noah said that he will prove he is superior and return to the real world in Seto's body, where he will take over KaibaCorp. Seto laughs at the idea of Noah beating him and being able to run KaibaCorp. He accepted the challenge and selected \"[[Kaiser Sea Horse (anime)|Kaiser Sea Horse]]\" as his [[Deck Master]].<ref name=\"ep 114\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|114|ref}}</ref>\n\nYugi and his friends arrived to watch the Duel.<ref name=\"ep 114\" /> After a few turns, Seto got a chance to win, but Noah used Mokuba as human shield.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|115|ref}}</ref> Kaiba refused to attack Mokuba and ended his turn. Seto tried talking Mokuba into returning to his side. Yugi pointed out that he was in this situation before when [[Marik Ishtar|Marik]] possessed Joey and urged Seto to keep fighting to awaken his bond with Mokuba. Kaiba managed to Summon \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\". Mokuba recognized this as the [[Mokuba Kaiba's \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" drawing|the card he drew]] for Seto. Mokuba imagined Seto and himself on the back of a \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" and broke free from Noah's influence. With \"Blue-Eyes\" out, Seto played \"[[Last Turn (anime)|Last Turn]]\" creating one final battle to determine the winner of the Duel. Kaiba choose \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", with 3000 [[ATK]] as his monster and Noah chooses his Deck Master, \"[[Shinato's Ark (anime)|Shinato's Ark]]\", but revealed its true form \"[[Shinato, King of a Higher Plane (anime)|Shinato, King of a Higher Plane]]\", with 3300 ATK. \"Shinato\" defeated \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", causing Seto to lose the Duel.<ref name=\"ep 116\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|116|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx116 Stone Mokuba and Seto.jpg|thumb|right|Mokuba and Seto turned to stone after Seto's Duel with Noah.]]\nHaving defeated Seto, Noah turned Seto and Mokuba into stone. However Yugi accused Noah of foul play, by causing Seto to give up his chance for winning over his brother's safety. Yugi then challenged Noah to continue the Duel with him. Should Yugi win everyone Noah trapped would be freed. Yugi combined his Deck with Seto's and continued the Duel from where Seto had left off.<ref name=\"ep 116\" /> When Yugi was on the brink of defeat, he imagined everyone Noah had turned to stone, including Seto, were with him. They each handed Yugi a card to draw with \"[[Card of Sanctity (anime)|Card of Sanctity]]\".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|118|ref}}</ref> Using them Yugi defeated Noah, returning everyone who was turned to stone to the way they were before.<ref name=\"ep 119\"/>\n\nGozaburo appeared in the sky before Noah and his prisoners, revealing that he had digitized his mind after losing KaibaCorp to Seto. Gozaburo revealed how he had used Seto to motivate Noah and previously planned to use his body to host Noah's mind. After Gozaburo uploaded his mind into the Virtual World, he planned to take Seto's body for himself. He no longer intended to do that as he has plans to digitize the entire world and rule it.<ref name=\"ep 119\" />\n\nNoah led the prisoners, claiming to be taking them to an exit. Despite not trusting Noah, Kaiba went along. As he predicted, Noah betrayed them and split the gang up.<ref name=\"ep 119\" /> Kaiba headed to the virtual KaibaCorp headquarters to confront Gozaburo.<ref name=\"ep 120\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|120|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx121 Monster Gozaburo vs Seto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gozaburo Kaiba|Gozaburo]], in his monster form, attacks Seto.]]\nGozaburo imposed a game of ''Duel Monsters'' for Seto to play for his freedom. Seto accepted and found himself struggling against Gozaburo's \"[[Exodia Necross (anime)|Exodia Necross]]\".<ref name=\"ep 120\" /> However he found its weakness and removed the \"[[Exodia]]\" pieces from Gozaburo's Graveyard, stripping it of its abilities. Seto defeated \"Exodia Necross\" with \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", winning the Duel.<ref name=\"ep 121\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|121|ref}}</ref>\n\nGozaburo was unwilling to give up and transformed into a monster and proceeded to attack Seto. Yugi appeared and managed to save Seto in time. Noah had set the virtual world servers to self-destruct, but having had a change of heart, he helped Seto and Yugi escape. He told them to jump off the KaibaCorp building and opened a gateway to the real world, which they passed through before hitting the ground. Before leaving Kaiba exclaimed, \"I won't be buried with you, Gozaburo\".<ref name=\"ep 121\" />\n\nYugi, Kaiba and Mokuba ran to escape the fortress before the missiles struck. Joey and Tristan helped them get onto the moving blimp, as they left Noah's fortress, before it got destroyed.<ref name=\"ep 121\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n====Battle City finals====\nKaiba, his colleagues and guests arrived safely at [[Alcatraz]] for the [[Battle City]] finals.<ref name=\"ep 122\" />\n\nKaiba, Yugi, Joey and Marik partook in a [[Battle Royal]] to determine the matchups for the semi-finals. Each Duelist selected a monster to exclude from their Deck to determine the order of play. Kaiba chose the \"[[Masked Beast Des Gardius (anime)|Masked Beast Des Gardius]]\", which he had taken from [[Lumis]]. Since it had the highest ATK, Kaiba got to go first.<ref name=\"ep 122\" /> Since \"[[The Winged Dragon of Ra (anime)|The Winged Dragon of Ra]]\" is the strongest of the [[Egyptian Gods]], Kaiba planned to win \"Slifer\" off Yugi so he could have two Egyptian Gods when facing Marik and \"Ra\". Wanting to face Yugi in the semi-finals and too proud to purposely lose, Kaiba made sure he and Yugi were the last two standing in the Battle Royal, matching them up for the second semi-final.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|123|ref}}</ref><ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|124|ref}}</ref>\n\nBefore Joey's Duel with Marik, Kaiba commented that Joey didn't stand a chance against \"The Winged Dragon of Ra\". Joey protested that he went up against \"Ra\" before, but Kaiba reminded him how it knocked him unconscious. Kaiba told Yugi that his computer had managed to translate \"Ra's\" effects. However, Yugi was unconvinced and believed Kaiba's connection with the past played a part in translating the text. Kaiba planned to use Joey as a guinea pig, so he can study Marik's strategy. Had it been Yugi that was facing Marik, Marik would win \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\" making it harder for Kaiba to defeat him in the finals. Yugi smirked that Kaiba's plan had a flaw; he has to get past him first.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|125|ref}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the Duel, Marik had Joey hit hard by one of \"Ra's\" effects. Mokuba protests that Marik has gone too far, but Kaiba refused to stop the Duel as he must see \"Ra's\" abilities with his own eyes. Kaiba was stunned to see Joey still standing after taking the blast. Joey prepared to attack Marik directly with his \"[[Gearfried the Iron Knight (anime)|Gearfried the Iron Knight]]\" to win, but collapsed. Kaiba gave Joey 30 seconds to rise. Unable to do so, Joey was disqualified. Kaiba was impressed with Joey's performance, thinking to himself \"The way you die, at last I'll recognize you as a Duelist\". (In the dub, Kaiba actually thought to himself that Joey's performance in the Duel was quite impressive, and finally realized that Joey wasn't the third-rate amateur he thought he was.)<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|128|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx131 Yugi vs Kaiba.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba and Yugi face each other with their Egyptian Gods in the Colosseum.]]\nKaiba faced Yugi in the second semi-final. He created a holographic Colosseum of spectators around the top of the tower for the Duel.<ref name=\"ep 129\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|129|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba tried to Summon \"[[Obelisk the Tormentor (anime)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]\" at an early stage, but Yami Yugi manages to counter both his attempts. Kaiba stole \"Slifer\" from Yugi's Deck using \"[[Lullaby of Obedience (anime)|Lullaby of Obedience]]\". However Yami took it back with \"[[Exchange (anime)|Exchange]]\", which he had been planning to use on \"Obelisk\".<ref name=\"ep 129\" /> Yami and Kaiba each managed to Summon their respective Egyptian Gods.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|130|ref}}</ref> The two constantly altered the Gods' [[ATK]] or blocked each others [[attack]]s, preventing the other from destroying their God. Kaiba attempted to win using \"Obelisk's\" effect, Tributing two monsters to inflict 4000 [[effect damage|damage]] to Yami, but Yami discarded \"[[Kuriboh (anime)|Kuriboh]]\" to protect himself. Eventually the two Gods attacked each other and after a number of alterations each ended up with 4000 ATK<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|131|ref}}</ref> and destroyed each other.<ref name=\"ep 132\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|132|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx132 Yami and Seto watch the ancient Duel.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba and Yami Yugi see a vision of [[Priest Seto|Sorcerer Seto]] and the [[Pharaoh Atem|Nameless Pharaoh]] battling.]]\nThe battle of Gods caused Yami Yugi and Kaiba's consciousness to be transported to an ancient city. Here they saw \"Obelisk\" and \"Slifer\" turned to stone, while elsewhere, the [[Priest Seto|Sorcerer Seto]] and [[Pharaoh Atem|Nameless Pharaoh]] battled. The Sorcerer told the Pharaoh that he's powerless in the face of the darkness and the land will soon meet the fate of its destruction. When questioned as to why he joined the forces of darkness, the sorcerer replied that he and his followers had allegiance to neither [[Zorc Necrophades|the Dark One]] nor the Pharaoh. The Sorcerer Summoned [[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (character)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]] from a tablet and the Pharaoh countered with [[Dark Magician (character)|Dark Magician]]. The two returned to present time. Kaiba asked if Yami had the same vision as he did. Yami claimed that their Duel is related to the one from 3000 years ago (5000 years in the dub), and Kaiba said their Duel is destined. (In the dub, Kaiba calls the vision an illusion.)<ref name=\"ep 132\" />\n\nKaiba and Yami continued the Duel. They quickly Summoned \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" and \"[[Dark Magician (anime)|Dark Magician]]\" respectively.<ref name=\"ep 132\" /> Kaiba used \"[[Lord of D.|Lord of Dragons]]\" and \"[[The Flute of Summoning Dragon (anime)|The Flute of Summoning Dragon]]\" to bring out his other two \"Blue-Eyes White Dragons\". Yugi used it to Summon Joey's \"[[Red-Eyes B. Dragon (anime)|Red-Eyes Black Dragon]]\" from his own hand. Yami blocked the attacks from two of the three dragons, destroying one of them and \"Lord of Dragons\" in the process.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|133|ref}}</ref> Kaiba used \"[[Monster Reborn (anime)|Monster Reborn]]\" and \"[[Polymerization (anime)|Polyerization]]\" to Summon \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\", but Yami played \"[[Double Spell (anime)|Double Spell]]\" copying Kaiba's last two [[Spell Card|Magic Cards]], allowing him to Summon \"[[Dark Paladin (anime)|Dark Paladin]]\". Yami told Kaiba that if he stands at the top filled with hatred, he won't find real victory. He'll only have to find new hatred, and his future will be filled with endless hatred. Kaiba attacked \"Dark Paladin\" with \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\", but Yami used \"[[De-Fusion (anime)|De-Fusion]]\", splitting the \"Ultimate Dragon\" into three \"Blue-Eyes White Dragons\". He used \"[[Diffusion Wave-Motion (anime)|Diffusion Wave-Motion]]\", allowing \"Dark Paladin\" to attack all three of them, winning the Duel.<ref name=\"ep 134\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|134|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba thought Battle City was his tournament, the entire event was designed so that he would be victorious, he wanted to put the memory of his adoptive father behind him and be crowned the world's best Duelist atop his [[Duel Tower]]. Despite coming so close, his victory slipped away from him. Yugi compliments Kaiba on the Duel, but Kaiba said he doesn't want his pity. Yugi admitted Kaiba is a strong Duelist, but he was defeated by the monster in his heart called \"hatred\". Yugi pointed out how friendship helped him win, but Kaiba said that everyone is alone in this world and he doesn't want any pals to slow him down. Yugi called that sad, to which he just scoffs. Kaiba accepted his defeat and angrily gave Yugi his \"Obelisk the Tormentor\" card, as per the rules of the tournament.<ref name=\"ep 135\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|135|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx136 Blue-Eyes vs Blue-Eyes.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba Duels Joey.]]\nAs Kaiba left, Joey, who had awoken from his coma, challenged Kaiba to a third place play-off. Kaiba wasn't interested at first and considered Dueling Joey to be waste of time. But Joey persisted and Kaiba eventually accepted. At the bottom of the Duel Tower, the two faced off. Kaiba played \"[[Crush Card Virus (later DM anime)|Crush Card Virus]]\" at an early stage, eliminating Joey's stronger monsters.<ref name=\"ep 135\" /> Regardless Joey put up a good fight. He annoyed Kaiba by taking control of one of his \"Blue-Eyes White Dragons\".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|136|ref}}</ref> Towards the end of the Duel, Joey attempted to win by using \"[[Time Wizard (anime)|Time Wizard]]\" to age \"[[Baby Dragon (anime)|Baby Dragon]]\" into \"[[Thousand Dragon (anime)|Thousand Dragon]]\" and weaken Kaiba's \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\". Kaiba scolded Joey for thinking the Duel is fun. When Kaiba told Joey he never has any fun even in a Duel, Joey couldn't help but grin in amusement. This proved Kaiba was a more miserable person than Joey thought he was. (In the dub, he mocked Joey for relying on luck to win his Duels.) Kaiba used \"[[Interdimensional Matter Transporter (anime)|Interdimensional Matter Transporter]]\" to save his dragon from \"Time Wizard\" and won on his next turn. Kaiba left thinking the Duel was a waste of time.<ref name=\"ep 137\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|137|ref}}</ref>\n\nInitially Kaiba had no intention of watching the final Duel between Yugi and Marik, but was confronted by [[Ishizu Ishtar|Ishizu]], who told him Yugi is going to need his help to defeat Marik. Kaiba walked away, not caring if Yugi loses. Ishizu called him back and said \"pret kreto\", an Ancient Egyptian phrase, which to Kaiba's own surprise, he understood. She said that these words were prayers for the dead, from a friend that were engraved on a stone found in the [[Tomb of the Nameless Pharaoh|Pharaoh's temple]]. (In the dub, Ishizu didn't speak Ancient Egyptian and told Kaiba that his own future is at stake.) Ishizu told Kaiba of his connection to the sorcerer, who was the Pharaoh's rival, but ultimately helped the Pharaoh save his people and now history is repeating itself. Kaiba was unconvinced and left to prepare for the detonation of the Duel Tower. However, Mokuba started to cry that Yugi and Joey were right about Kaiba being filled with hate, Dueling for all the wrong reasons and never having fun anymore either.<ref name=\"ep 137\" />\n\nKaiba reconsidered and decided to help Yugi, despite hosting the tournament to beat him. Kaiba estimated Yugi's chances of winning to be 3%, but he has a card that can beat \"The Winged Dragon of Ra\". If Yugi could figure out how to use it, it would give him a 20% chance of winning. (Kaiba made no such calculations in the dub.) As he made his way to the Duel, Kaiba remembered Yugi saying that the strength of his friends brought him victory and wondered if Yugi can create a miracle if he entrusts him with this card. (In the dub, Kaiba thought he'd enjoy watching Yugi fall at the hands of Marik, but it would be interesting to see if Yugi has what it takes to use this card.) Before the Duel, Kaiba gave Yugi the card, \"[[Fiend's Sanctuary (anime)|Fiend's Sanctuary]]\". Kaiba told Ishizu that he only helped Yugi to prove her wrong when he loses.<ref name=\"ep 137\" />\n\nKaiba watched the Duel and saw the card he gave Yugi, help out.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|139|ref}}</ref> He congratulated Yugi after he won.<ref name=\"ep 142\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|142|ref}}</ref>\n\nWith the tournament over, Kaiba and Mokuba, initiated the self-destruction of the [[Alcatraz|Duel Tower]] to destroy their memory of Gozaburo and his loss to Yugi.<ref name=\"ep 142\" /> While everyone else left in the helicopter, Kaiba and Mokuba leave in the Blue-Eyes White Dragon jet, as they planned to start work on [[Kaiba Land]] in America right away.<ref name=\"ep 143\"/>\n\n====Pyramid of Light====\n{{ambox|type=notice|small=left|style=width:350px;|text=The following events from ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

In order to find a way to overpower them, he set off to where Pegasus, the creator of the game, resided to get the answers he required.\n\n====Waking the Dragons====\nWhen real ''[[Duel Monsters]]'' started appearing, [[KaibaCorp]] got plenty of phone calls from people, who believed they were created by Kaiba's [[Solid Vision]]. Kaiba, who was still in America working on [[Kaiba Land]], made an announcement on TV. He said that they had shut down their system as a test and found the monsters still appeared, so something other than their system is causing the monsters to be created.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|145|ref}}</ref>\n\nIn his office, Kaiba thinks that someone is trying to make a fool out of him and wondered if the monster appearances were the doing of one of his rivals. He suspected [[Industrial Illusions]] and got [[Roland]] to contact them. Mokuba rushed into the office and tells Kaiba that someone has bought all of their stocks. [[Alister]], pretending to be [[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]] calls Kaiba, claiming to be the one who bought the stocks, but he's not interested in Kaiba's company. He tells Kaiba that he must Duel him in Duelist Kingdom, or else, he will sell all of his stocks, ruining the Kaiba Corporation, and therefore, destroy his goal of building Kaiba Land.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|148|ref}}</ref><ref name=\"ep 149\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|149|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba and Mokuba took the [[Blue-Eyes White Dragon jet]] to [[Duelist Kingdom (island)|Duelist Kingdom]]. They confronted Alister disguised as Pegasus in the castle. Kaiba accused him of being responsible for the monster appearances. Alister claimed that it's all Kaiba's responsibility. Kaiba demanded to know what he meant, and Alister said that he will tell him if Kaiba can beat him in a Duel. Alister used the [[Dueling Arena]], while Kaiba choose to put his cards on his [[Duel Disk]], as he did not trust Pegasus.<ref name=\"ep 149\" />\n\n[[File:DMx150 Critias awakened.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba frees [[Critias]].]]\nAlister used Pegasus' [[Toon monster|Toon]] strategy. Kaiba stopped this by [[destroy]]ing \"[[Toon World (anime)|Toon World]]\" and accused Pegasus of using the same old strategy. After noting that Pegasus isn't predictable, he doubted he was facing the real Pegasus, so Alister revealed the disguise. Alister then played \"[[The Seal of Orichalcos (anime)|The Seal of Orichalcos]]\", so that the loser would lose their soul.<ref name=\"ep 149\" /> Alister accuses Kaiba of ruining his life, since his brother had been killed (went missing in the dub) in a war, where [[Gozaburo Kaiba|Gozaburo]] sold weapons to both sides. Since Alister had been studying Kaiba, he was able to predict that Kaiba would rely on \"[[Crush Card Virus (later DM anime)|Crush Card Virus]]\", and prevented this with \"[[Royal Decree (anime)|Royal Decree]]\". He took control of two of Kaiba's \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]s\" to stage the perfect revenge. Kaiba realized that there wasn't a card in his Deck that could save him, but before drawing his next card, his consciousness was transported to a hall, where he sees two dragons trapped crystal. He removes a sword from one of the dragons, freeing it. To Kaiba's surprise, he somehow knows the dragon's name is [[Critias]]. (In the dub, [[Dark Magician Girl (character)|Dark Magician Girl]] told him that he had been chosen to release Critius and instructed him to remove the sword). Kaiba returned to reality and drew his next card, \"[[Fang of Critias]]\", which was not in his Deck before. He combined it with \"Crush Card\", forming \"[[Doom Virus Dragon (anime)|Doom Virus Dragon]]\". He used \"Doom Virus Dragon\" to destroy Alister's monsters and attack him, but Alister played \"[[Contagion of Madness]]\", making the Duel a [[DRAW]]. Since it was a DRAW, neither player lost their soul.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|150|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards Kaiba wondered about the card, \"The Fang of Critias\". After boarding his jet, he received an e-mail from HQ, saying that he needed to come back, but Kaiba opted to visit [[Industrial Illusions]] to ask about the card instead.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|151|ref}}</ref> Mokuba was unable to contact Pegasus on the way. Kaiba suspected that this would happen; whoever Alister is working for has already captures Pegasus and wants him next. Kaiba wondered how he could know the effect of the card; he doesn't believe in the supernatural, but the power of the card is very real.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|152|ref}}</ref> While on the jet, Kaiba noticed \"The Fang of Critias\" glowing while elsewhere Joey Wheeler acquired \"[[Claw of Hermos]]\".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|153|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx154 Holographic Pegasus.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba encounters the holographic recording of Pegasus.]]\nKaiba arrived at [[Industrial Illusions]] American headquarters, where he encountered Yugi, Joey, Téa, Tristan and [[Duke Devlin|Duke]]. He asked about Pegasus and learned that [[Mai Valentine]] has been there earlier and taken his soul using \"The Seal of Orichalcos\". Kaiba briefed the others in on his encounter with the impostor Pegasus, who he believes is trying to take over his company. In search of answers, the group followed by [[Rex Raptor|Rex]] and [[Weevil Underwood|Weevil]] go to a private room, which Yugi is able to open using a card Pegasus gave him. A hologram of Pegasus informed the party about [[Doma]]'s involvement in historical events. Kaiba recalled Gozaburo saying something about a dark force behind the world economy, which he now believes could be Doma. (In the dub, Kaiba says that this is just a hoax by Pegasus.)<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|154|ref}}</ref> Kaiba learned that Yugi and Joey also have [[Legendary Dragon]] cards like \"Critias\" and Yami claimed it was their destiny to work together to defeat Doma. However Kaiba left them, claiming that he's the one who decides his fate.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|155|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter Kaiba returned to KaibaCorp headquarters, he received word of their stock plummeting and nearly half of the company being bought out by an unknown investor. Kaiba believed that it was Doma's doing and had his employees research what they could find about Doma. Mokuba was concerned about Kaiba facing Alister, again as he believed that Alister was simply fighting for his brother. However, Kaiba insisted that he must knock Doma down or there won't be any hope for KaibaCorp or Kaiba Land. (In the dub, Kaiba believed that Pegasus was behind the problems and Mokuba suggested that it could be Alister.)<ref name=\"ep 156\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|156|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba received a phone call from Joey, who asked him for a lift to Florida in exchange for information about Doma, but Joey got overexcited and told him that [[Rafael|one of them]] defeated Yugi in a Duel and took his soul. Kaiba became outraged over Yugi throwing away his championship title to some \"nobody\" and not him. He called Yami a disgrace to the game and hung up the phone, thinking that this is just another excuse to hunt down those thugs.<ref name=\"ep 156\" />\n\nOn board a company plane, as Kaiba and Mokuba notice a bizarre light phenomenon outside the window, the pilot, who is Alister in disguise reports that there will be some turbulence.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|165|ref}}</ref> The brothers get curious as to what is going on and find that the rest of the plane is empty. They finally found Alister, who demands a rematch and informs them that the other passengers had been evacuated before the flight, as he didn't want them to interfere with their Duel (in the dub, he said that the other passengers had been an illusion). Kaiba flipped a switch, which removed the furniture and cleared a space for Dueling. Alister vowed to hang Kaiba's soul on [[Mikey]]'s tombstone and the Duel began.<ref name=\"ep 166\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|166|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx166 Duel on top of the plane.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba and Alister Duel on top of the plane.]]\nOnce Alister played \"The Seal of Orichalcos\", its green light damaged the plane and switched off the autopilot. The sides of the plane appeared as if they disappeared and the seal rose Kaiba and Alister to the roof of the plane and formed a dome over itself.<ref name=\"ep 166\" />\n\nDuring the Duel, Kaiba is sent to an illusion of a city that was made a battlefield by KaibaCorp, when [[Gozaburo Kaiba|Gozaburo]] was in power. Kaiba appeared in a hideout, where he met [[Aaron]], who looks like Mokuba. Aaron, along with [[Tony]] and [[Dennis]] had collected weapons from the battlefield to give to people protecting the city. (The references to the weapons were removed in the dub.) \n\n[[File:DMx166 Improvised chess.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba in the war struck city, playing an improvised game of [[chess]] with [[Aaron]].]]\n\nOutside, Aaron offered to play [[chess]] with Kaiba by etching the board in the soil and using empty weapon cartridges as pieces. This reminded Kaiba of how he used to play chess with Mokuba in the orphanage before they were adopted. (The game of chess was removed in the dub.) Kaiba and Aaron were interrupted when the hideout was bombed. Aaron tried to run over there to save Tony and Dennis, but Kaiba stopped him, insisting that it was too dangerous. When Aaron turns to Kaiba to plead, he turns into Mokuba pleading to Kaiba. A tank then appeared and shot at Kaiba and Aaron. The tank turned out to be one of Alister's cards and the Duel resumed in the city, while Aaron had disappeared. Alister explained what Kaiba had seen had really happened before; Aaron, Dennis and Tony were his friends growing up, that attack from the tank had killed Aaron and Alister's brother [[Mikey]] had been killed in the same way. (The mentions of death are removed in the dub.) The vision of the city faded shortly afterwards and the Duel continued on the airplane. Alister accused Kaiba of being like Gozaburo and expressed his wishes for a world free of war, which isn't possible with people like Gozaburo. To achieve such a world, he claimed to need Kaiba's soul.<ref name=\"ep 166\" />\n\nAfter sending an SOS to [[Roland]], Mokuba appeared to watch and begged Kaiba to stop the Duel or Alister would lose his soul. Kaiba claimed that he needed to defeat Alister for the sake of Kaiba Land. (In the dub, he said that he doesn't back down from a challenge.) Roland appeared with a team of helicopters to rescue the Kaiba brothers later in the Duel. Kaiba asks Alister if he would destroy the whole world if it meant hurting Mikey. Kaiba then goes to tell Alister that what happened to Mikey was Alister's fault, as it is an older brother's duty to protect the younger brother. Alister, outraged, used the \"Seal of Orichalcos\" to damage the plane further and send it plummeting and then refuses to end his turn, telling Kaiba that he can't protect his brother either. Mokuba calls to Alister to think what Mikey would think of Alister if he saw him acting like this, causing Alister to see Mikey in Mokuba. Kaiba tells Alister that no matter what he won't let anything happen to Mokuba and that he can win in one turn if Alister ends his turn. Alister agrees to give Kaiba one chance, to see if Kaiba can really protect Mokuba and he ends his turn. Kaiba used \"The Fang of Critias\" to form \"[[Tyrant Burst Dragon (anime)|Tyrant Burst Dragon]]\", whose effect powered up his \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" (in the dub, the combination was called \"Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon\"), and defeated Alister before the plane crashed. Mokuba mourns over Alister's soulless body while Kaiba runs to the cockpit. Kaiba asks Alister if he can hear him because he will land the plane and not let Mokuba get hurt. The three Legendary Dragons, [[Timaeus]], [[Critias]] and [[Hermos]] then appeared and carried the plane to a safe landing.<ref name=\"ep 167\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|167|ref}}</ref>\n\nAt some point, Kaiba sent men to the [[Florida museum|museum in Florida]] to find clues regarding the undersea ruins.<ref name=\"ep 168\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|168|ref}}</ref>\n\nOutside the plane, Kaiba and Mokuba met Joey, Téa, Tristan and Yami, who had followed the dragons. Roland landed his helicopter and informed them of KaibaCorp being bought out by Doma.<ref name=\"ep 167\" /> Yami tried to convince Kaiba that they were brought together for a reason. Despite not believing in destiny, Kaiba said they might be useful and gave them a lift in one of the helicopters. Despite no longer working for Kaiba, Roland and [[Fuguta]] vowed to help him. Kaiba receives images of the ruins from the men he sent to the museum, who are attacked by ninjas immediately afterwards. Kaiba sent the data from the ruins to [[Rebecca Hawkins|Rebecca's]] laptop. However the ruins were too worn for her and [[Arthur Hawkins|Arthur]] to decipher them. Kaiba ordered the pilot to take them to the [[United States KaibaCorp headquarters]]. Despite it being taken over by Doma, it had the necessary technology to clear-up the images.<ref name=\"ep 168\" />\n\n[[File:DMx168 Monsters waiting.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba and Yami ambushed by [[Duel Monster Spirits]].]]\nThe group met up with Duke, Arthur and Rebecca at the pier near the KaibaCorp building. Kaiba and Yami took an underground passage into the building. Once they got inside they were attacked, by [[Duel Monster Spirits]]. By playing cards on their Duel Disks, Yami and Kaiba were able to Summon monsters to fight them off. The monsters are eventually destroyed and the two are cornered. However Rebecca, who hacked into the security system manages to open and close doors to Kaiba and Yami's advantage safely guiding them to the central computer mainframe. Using the computer, Kaiba cleaned-up the images and sent them to Arthur, who translated them as a prophecy about [[The Great Leviathan|a black serpent]] returning and [[Atlantis]] ruling again. Kaiba recognized an insignia on the ruins as that of [[Paradius]].<ref name=\"ep 168\" />\n\nThe president of Paradius, [[Dartz]], destroys the computers and appears before Kaiba and Yami standing on [[The Great Leviathan]]. Kaiba figured that Dartz is also in charge of Doma. Yami and Kaiba attempt to Duel him and Summon \"The Eye of Timaeus\" and \"The Fang of Critias\". However Dartz disappeared before they could attack him. The Duel Spirits then broke into the room, causing Kaiba and Yami to flee to the roof, where they boarded the [[Blue-Eyes White Dragon jet]] and crash landed.<ref name=\"ep 168\" />\n\nKaiba and Yami met up with the others and got the location of Paradius headquarters from Rebecca. However they were ambushed by [[Orichalcos Soldier]]s,<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|169|ref}}</ref> who Yami and Kaiba managed to fight off by Summoning \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias\". Kaiba then left the group to find defeat Dartz himself and reminded them that they can use his satellite system to track Joey's location.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|170|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba and Mokuba stopped at a car shop and hopped into [[Kaiba's car|a sportscar]]. The [[Car salesman|salesman]] tried to stop them, but Kaiba handed him a check for $500,000 and sped off.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|171|ref}}</ref> They were stopped by a group of [[Orichalcos Soldier]]s one block from the headquarters.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|172|ref}}</ref> Kaiba fought them off using \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" and \"The Fang of Critias\"<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|173|ref}}</ref> and continued to drive to the headquarters, but was stopped once again when he bumped into Téa and Tristan with Joey's now soulless body. They were forced to abandon the car as they got onto a fire escape to get away from a swarm of rats with glowing red eyes. The five of them then made their way to the Paradius headquarters, where they found Yami Dueling [[Rafael]].<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|174|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Duel, the building started to collapse. Fortunately for the group, Roland arrived in the helicopter to rescue them. They witnessed the outside of the building crumble away, revealing an Atlantian building inside it. Yami handed Kaiba a chip, he received from Raphael, which Kaiba inserted into a device and found it contained a map to Dartz's lair. They prepared to fly towards it, but military helicopters appeared and gestured them to follow. They were guided through a swarm of locusts and onto the [[USS Courage|USS ''Courage'']]. (The locusts were removed in the dub.)<ref name=\"ep 177\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|177|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe military asked for their help in defeating Doma. Doma had been controlling the country's politics preventing them from initiating an attack (in the dub, Dartz had not been leaving enough evidence to allow them to attack). The military then flew them to Dartz's temple.<ref name=\"ep 177\" />\n\nInside the temple, they found the souls of everyone taken by \"The Seal of Orichalcos\" sealed in slabs lining the walls. Dartz appeared before them and explained that he has spent ten millennia collecting the souls to revive The Great Leviathan. For the souls to be freed, Dartz said that the [[Pharaoh Atem|Nameless Pharaoh]] must defeat him first. Not wanting to face Dartz alone, Yami enlisted Kaiba for help and the two of them faced Dartz together.<ref name=\"ep 177\" />\n\n[[File:DMx180 Kaiba loses his soul.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba loses his soul in the Duel against [[Dartz]].]]\nDuring the Duel, the Orichalcos generated another vision of the past. This time they witnessed [[Atlantis]] ten millennia previous, as it became corrupted by the Orichalcos, resulting in the [[Battle of Atlantis]], which caused the city to sink.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|178|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe two managed to work together as a team, but when Dartz's \"[[Mirror Knight Token]]s\" bore the faces of Yugi, Joey, [[Mai Valentine|Mai]] and Pegasus, all of whom had been taken by \"The Seal of Orichalcos\", Kaiba was unable to talk Yami into attacking them. Kaiba learned that Dartz had been disguised as Gozaburo in order to manipulate Alister into hating the Kaiba family.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|179|ref}}</ref> Kaiba finally lost, but transferred the [[ATK]] of his \"[[Mirror Force Dragon (anime)|Mirror Force Dragon]]\" to Yami's [[Life Points]] using \"[[Wish of Final Effort]]\", before losing his soul.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|180|ref}}</ref> Yami made use of the extra Life Points to win the Duel.<ref name=\"ep 181\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|181|ref}}</ref><ref name=\"ep 182\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|182|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter he lost, Kaiba's soul was inside a bubble being sucked into The Great Leviathan, along with some of the other lost souls.<ref name=\"ep 181\" /> Once Yami defeated Dartz, the [[Legendary Knight]]s freed the chosen Duelists; Yugi, Joey and Kaiba, from the Leviathan.<ref name=\"ep 182\" />\n\nOutside, the group found that Atlantis has risen out of the sea. Kaiba, Yugi and Joey returned into temple to find Dartz. Yugi handed Kaiba and Joey back their Legendary Dragon cards and the trio entered a vortex transporting them to the heart of Atlantis. They found that Dartz had left his body and combined with The Great Leviathan, to compensate for not getting the souls of the chosen Duelists.<ref name=\"ep 182\" />\n\nKaiba, Yami and Joey Summoned a barrage of monsters to battle the leviathan<ref name=\"ep 182\" /> and are accompanied by an army [[Dark Magician Girl (character)|Dark Magician Girl]] brought from the [[Duel Monsters Spirit World|Spirit World]]. However the Leviathan shot tendrils at the three Duelists and pulled them inside it. By absorbing the strength of the other souls within the leviathan, Yami managed to Summon the [[Egyptian Gods]] and free himself, Kaiba and Joey. Kaiba witnessed the Gods attacking the Leviathan, freeing the souls it had taken.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|183|ref}}</ref>\n\nAs Yami battled what was left of The Great Leviathan, Kaiba and Joey were forced to leave Atlantis as a tidal wave approached. They met up with the others and took off in the KaibaCorp helicopter. After The Great Leviathan was defeated and Atlantis sunk once more, Kaiba's \"The Fang of Critias\" card disappeared.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|184|ref}}</ref>\n\n====Grand Championship====\nKaiba managed to reclaim the stock he lost to Doma, but KaibaCorp still lost a lot of reputation and the price of its stock went down. Mokuba suggested that they host a tournament at the grand opening of the USA [[Kaiba Land]]. Kaiba agreed and decided to call it the KaibaCorp [[Grand Championship]]. He sent invites to some of the greatest Duelists in the world, but, because of his busy schedule, he was not able to take part himself.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|185|ref}}</ref> He arranged it as a sixteen player knockout with the winner facing Yugi.<ref name=\"ep 186\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|186|ref}}</ref>\n\nAt the opening of the Kaiba Land [[Zigfried von Schroeder]] hacked into the [[Kaiba Dome]]'s computer system. By the time Kaiba arrived at the Dome, Yugi had defeated the CPU in a game of ''Duel Monsters'', restoring control to normal. Unsure who did it, Kaiba tightened security and vowed to punish the hacker.<ref name=\"ep 186\" />\n\n[[File:DMx187 Jetpack.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba jetpacks into the Kaiba Dome.]]\nAt the beginning of the tournament Kaiba jetpacked into the Kaiba Dome to introduce the tournament as the ultimate test of survival with Kaiba Land as its battlefield.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|187|ref}}</ref>\n\nWith the tournament running too smoothly, Kaiba suspected the hacker must be already be in Kaiba Land and got Roland to perform a background check on all the competitors in the tournament. Kaiba grew suspicious of Zigfried, who had entered the tournament under the name \"Zigfried Lloyd\", when he saw him announce to a surveillance camera that he has a special show in store for Kaiba, before Dueling [[Rex Raptor|Rex]] and [[Weevil Underwood|Weevil]], who snuck in.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|189|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba prepared for an attack on the computer system, such that he would be able to completely back-up the system should it get damaged.<ref name=\"ep 198\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|198|ref}}</ref>\n\nDuring Joey's Duel with Zigfried, Zigfried thought Kaiba was too slow with figuring him out and gave Kaiba a clue by triggering a virus causing electronics around the park to go haywire. Kaiba then remembered his encounter with Zigfried at the party thrown by Gozaburo.<ref name=\"ep 190\" /> Kaiba managed to stop the virus and ordered Roland to perform another background check on Zigfried Lloyd and find out if he's connected to the Schroeder family.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|191|ref}}</ref>\n\nThey found no personal or family information about Zigfried Lloyd, but plenty of tournament history and that he had entered these tournaments through the recommendation of politicians who were not available to comment. However Kaiba picked [[Bayern Governer Fravz]] from the list of politicians and insisted that they ask him again and mention that Kaiba still remembers \"what happened\". (In the dub, Kaiba told them to make him an offer he can't refuse.)<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|192|ref}}</ref> After finishing the background check, Kaiba's suspicions were confirmed<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|193|ref}}</ref> as he found Zigfried's true identity.<ref name=\"ep 194\" />\n\n[[File:DMx194 Get outta here.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba about to disqualify Zigfried.]]\nBefore the final Duel between Zigfried and [[Leon von Schroeder]], who had entered under the fake name \"Leon Wilson\", Kaiba interrupted and exposed Zigfried as Zigfried von Schroeder from [[Schroeder Corp]]. He accused Zigfried of causing the machines to go haywire, and disqualified him for entering under a fake name. Zigfried accused Kaiba of being a coward, afraid that someone from Schroeder Corp might win the tournament and become the world champion. Kaiba disagreed, commenting that he was kicking Zigfried out because he didn't like him, not because he was scared of him. Kaiba then broke his promise of not Dueling in the tournament in favor of embarrassing Zigfried on TV and challenged him to a Duel.<ref name=\"ep 194\" />\n\nAs they Dueled, Zigfried stated how KaibaCorp had always been one step ahead of Schroeder Corp in the gaming industry, including Kaiba making the contract with Pegasus to develop holographic technology for ''Duel Monsters'', just before he could make a similar contract. (In the dub, he accused Kaiba of stealing his invention.) With KaibaCorp's stock low, Zigfried planned to defeat Kaiba and destroy KaibaCorp's reputation and cause Pegasus to give up on KaibaCorp and make a new partnership with Schroeder Corp. However Kaiba went on to win the Duel.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|195|ref}}</ref> Believing that Zigfried is no longer a threat, Kaiba didn't bother having him removed.<ref name=\"ep 196\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|196|ref}}</ref>\n\nAs Leon faced Yugi in the title Duel, Kaiba noticed Leon was acting strange. One of his employees performed another background check on Leon Wilson and found that he is part of the Schroeder family. Zigfried appeared on Kaiba's balcony and revealed that Leon winning the tournament had been his plan all along. Kaiba was unable to disqualify Leon as the tournament rules forbade him from interrupting Duels.<ref name=\"ep 196\" />\n\nLeon played the card \"[[Golden Castle of Stromberg (anime)|Golden Castle of Stromberg]]\", which should be [[Illegal]], but Zigfried had hacked the system to allow it. Unbeknownst to Leon, Zigfried had also re-written the data on the card, so that it would inflict a deadly virus into KaibaCorp's computer system when played. Kaiba tried to launch an anti-virus, but was too late.<ref name=\"ep 197\"/> As Kaiba and his workers tried to stop the virus, Yugi managed to [[destroy]] \"Golden Castle of Stromberg\", stopping the virus from doing further damage.<ref name=\"ep 197\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|197|ref}}</ref>\n\nDespite Leon losing the Duel, Zigfried believed the virus had done enough damage to destroy years worth of programming, but due to his earlier preparations, Kaiba was able to restore everything.<ref name=\"ep 198\" />\n\n====Dawn of the Duel====\n[[File:Kaimemories.png|thumb|left|Kaiba's painful memories since Battle City.]]\n[[Yami Bakura]] appeared on Kaiba's computer screen to show him that he had kidnapped Mokuba and challenged Kaiba to a [[Shadow Game]] of ''Duel Monsters'' on the roof of the KaibaCorp building. To Kaiba's surprise purple mist surrounded them as they Dueled, but Bakura told Kaiba not to be so shocked as he used to play this game 3000 years ago (in the dub, he said that Kaiba's attitude hadn't changed in 5000 year). When Kaiba Summoned \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", Bakura showed him a vision of [[Priest Seto]] holding [[Kisara]] up to the \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" tablet. Bakura left before they could conclude the Duel and chucked Kaiba the [[Millennium Eye]], telling him to bring it to Egypt if he wants to understand the nature of his bond with Blue-Eyes White Dragon.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|200|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx202 Glowing eye.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba disturbed by the [[Millennium Eye]].]]\nRoland later informed Kaiba that Yugi and his friends had boarded a flight to Egypt. Wondering why they did that, Kaiba looked at the Millennium Eye and thought Bakura must have gotten to them. Kaiba initially had no interest, but after [[Diabound]] used \"Blue-Eyes'\" \"White Lightning\" attack in the [[Memory World]], Kaiba looked at Eye again, swearing he just heard \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\".<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|202|ref}}</ref> As Kaiba thought about what was going on the Eye started to glow and he saw another vision of Priest Seto standing on a balcony with the Pharaoh. Somewhat convinced, Kaiba took his Blue-Eyes White Dragon jet and flew to Cairo.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|203|ref}}</ref>\n\nAt Egypt, Kaiba landed near a museum, where he was greeted by the [[Marik Ishtar|Marik]], [[Ishizu Ishtar|Ishizu]] and [[Odion Ishtar]], who mistakenly thought he was here to see the pharaoh's tablet and told him that it had been moved to its original resting place. However Kaiba told them about Bakura and showed them the Millennium Eye. Fearing Bakura was up to no good, they advised Kaiba to go to the tablet to find out the truth.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|209|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx212 Vortex.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba sucked into the Memory World.]]\nKaiba arrived at the cavern where the tablet was. He found Bakura, Yugi, Joey, Téa and Tristan's bodies lying unconscious on the floor. The Millennium Eye then lit up and sent a beam at the tablet and showed him visions of Priest Seto and other Ancient Egyptians. At the [[Dark RPG]] table, Yami Bakura sucked Kaiba through a vortex into the Ancient Egyptian Memory World in order to absorb some of his soul to revive [[Thief Bakura]].<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|212|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba woke up in an alley afterwards and found that other people were unable to see him and could pass through him as if he wasn't there. However he met Kisara, who was able to see him and mistook him for Priest Seto. After realizing that he wasn't, she informed that an evil force was threatening their land and they must act quickly or everything would be lost. She bade him farewell and ran off.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|213|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx215 Kisara's body covered.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba and [[Pharaoh Atem|Atem]] watch [[Priest Seto|Seto]] cover [[Kisara]]'s body.]]\nKaiba followed Kisara and watched her warn Priest Seto of the danger. The two of them were then attacked by the [[Shadow Magus]]. Kaiba saw a battle between Kisara, Seto and later [[Pharaoh Atem]] against the Shadow Magus, which resulted in the deaths of Kisara and the Magus, as well as \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon's\" spirit being sealed in a tablet. Afterwards the Pharaoh, who Kaiba recognized as Yami Yugi spoke to him. He told him who Priest Seto is and that they are playing a Dark Game formed by the memories of 3000 years ago. He advised Kaiba to try and get out because [[Zorc Necrophades|Zorc]] was about to be revived.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|214|ref}}</ref> The two of them watched Seto cover Kisara's body (in the dub, Atem asked if Kaiba believed him now. Kaiba said that for all he knows it could be a bad dream. Atem looked at Seto and asked Kaiba to tell him that. However Kaiba asked if he's supposed to feel bad because some guy who looked like him lost his girlfriend). After Atem and Seto left, Kaiba took another look at Kisara's body. He remembered what she had said to him before but merely shrugged and left her to perish into dust.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|215|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba saw the [[Egyptian Gods]] battling Zorc and to his surprise saw the Gods defeated.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|217|ref}}</ref> He saw Seto Summon \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" to battle Zorc, but to his horror it also got destroyed. Kaiba went after Zorc as he attacked a city. He saw two boys running from Zorc and yelled at Zorc to stop. In response, Zorc blasted fire at him. Kaiba managed to dodge it, but was unable to get the boys to move before they were incinerated. (The fire and the boys being killed were removed from the dub.) A [[Duel Disk]] appeared on Kaiba's hand, which he used to Summon a \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\". Zorc reminded him that Seto had already tried that. However, Kaiba fused it with his other two \"Blue-Eyes White Dragons\" to form [[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (character)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]. As he did this, the souls of Kisara and Seto were drawn into the dragon. \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" and Zorc battled for a while. The ultimate collision of light and dark created a bridge between worlds and the real world became visible in the sky.<ref name=\"ep 218\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|218|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DMx218 Master of Dragon Soldier.jpg|thumb|left|Kaiba, Seto, Kisara and Atem combined to Summon \"[[Dragon Master Knight (anime)|Master of Dragon Soldier]]\".]]\nElsewhere Atem saw the \"Ultimate Dragon\" and thought Kaiba is the only person he's known to ever be able to Summon that monster. Using the power of the [[Millennium Puzzle]], [[Millennium Scale]] and his [[DiaDhank]], Atem gained the armor of \"[[Black Luster Soldier (anime)|Black Luster Soldier]]\" and fused himself and Kaiba with the Dragon creating \"[[Dragon Master Knight (anime)|Master of Dragon Soldier]]\". They attack Zorc, causing a massive burst of energy. The attack was strong, but didn't destroy Zorc. \"Master of Dragon Soldier\" disappeared and Atem and Kaiba returned to normal.<ref name=\"ep 218\" />\n\nAs Yugi and his friends tried to make the Pharaoh's hieroglyphic name appear on the [[cartouche]], Zorc launched an attack at them, but Kaiba blocked it using \"[[Ring of Defense (anime)|Ring of Defense]]\". Zorc then threw another fireball at the ring, destroying it and throwing Kaiba back. Atem finally learned his name from reading the cartouche. With knowledge of it, he was able to revive the Egyptian Gods and fuse them into [[The Creator God of Light, Horakhty]], who destroyed Zorc.<ref name=\"ep 219\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|219|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, Kaiba, Atem, Yugi, Téa and Tristan flew into the gateway in the sky to return to their world.<ref name=\"ep 219\" />\n\nThe group woke up back in the cavern with the tablets. Kaiba threw the Millennium Eye to Atem, who was back residing in Yugi's body. Joey began to question Kaiba on how he got it, but stopped at the sight of Bakura appearing. But they quickly found out it was the [[Bakura Ryou|\"good\" Bakura]]. As the others helped Bakura out, Kaiba stayed back with Atem and took a final look at the tablets.<ref name=\"ep 220\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|220|ref}}</ref>\n\nOutside the cavern, the group met the Ishtars, who were ready to take Atem to the [[Shrine of the Millennium Stone]] where he can finally be laid to rest. The group drove to a dock, where Kaiba was reunited with Mokuba.<ref name=\"ep 220\" />\n\n[[File:DMx220 Kaiba offers to Duel.jpg|thumb|right|Kaiba offers to Duel Atem in the [[Battle Ritual]].]]\nOn board the ship, Joey asked Kaiba why he was coming. Although he didn't answer, Ishizhu said that since his fate was influenced by the gods, Kaiba should witness this event with his own eyes (in the dub, she said that although Kaiba won't admit it, he is here to witness the Pharaoh's final rite of passage). After learning that Atem must lose a Duel as his final test, Joey and Kaiba both wanted to face him. However Yugi said that he will be the one to face Atem. Angrily Kaiba said that Yugi can't beat Atem (in the dub, Kaiba said he didn't come this far to see Yugi lose his title to his imaginary friend). Still unhappy, but accepting it, Kaiba told Yugi to at least build a real Deck if he's going to be Dueling and offered him a briefcase of cards to use to construct a Deck. Yugi declined in favor of using his and Atem's cards.<ref name=\"ep 220\" />\n\nThe next day the group were led to the Shrine of the Millennium Stone. Kaiba watched from the sidelines and witnessed the Pharaoh separate from Yugi's body. He commented that they were about to find out who the true King of Games is. As Kaiba predicted, Atem used the Egyptian God cards, but to Kaiba's surprise he managed to get all three on the field at once.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|221|ref}}</ref>\n\nThinking it was obvious who would win, Kaiba prepared to leave. Joey, Téa and Tristan tried talking him out of it, but to no avail. Kaiba thought that if the Pharaoh wins, at least he can have a rematch with him. Yugi then called Kaiba to stay, saying that he owes it to the Pharaoh (in the dub, he said that he thought Kaiba would like to see him beaten, but Kaiba replied that that was only if he was the one who got to beat him). Yugi insisted that the Pharaoh and Kaiba have a history and Kaiba should be here to say goodbye when he loses. Kaiba was surprised to hear that Yugi still thought he could win. Since Yugi was so determined, Kaiba said that he would stay until the end (in the dub, Kaiba said that once Yugi loses, he will show the pharaoh a real Duel).<ref name=\"ep 222\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|222|ref}}</ref>\n\nKaiba was unable to find any weakness in the God Cards and thought Yugi will have to show him a Duel beyond his imagination to beat them (in the dub, Kaiba thought that all this time the Pharaoh had been Dueling for Yugi, while Yugi took the credit).<ref name=\"ep 222\" /> To Kaiba's astonishment, Yugi managed to destroy the three God Cards by repeatedly redirecting the \"Lightning Blast\" effect of \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\" back at them in the one turn. Having never seen anything like it before, Kaiba said that he now believes Yugi (in the dub, he said that Yugi really is the true King of Games). Joey was surprised to see Kaiba cheering for Yugi. Kaiba was once again surprised when the Pharaoh said that he knew Yugi would defeat the Gods and that was only the first stage of the Duel. When Yugi was forced to battle the \"[[Dark Magician (anime)|Dark Magician]]\", Kaiba was glad that he stuck around.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|223|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter Yugi won, Kaiba watched Atem pass on into the afterlife. Once he was gone, the cavern started to collapse, and everyone ran outside. Kaiba and Mokuba left Egypt afterwards in the Blue-Eyes White Dragon jet.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|224|ref}}</ref>\n\n===''Yu-Gi-Oh!

He has full confidence that the Duelist representing Duel Academy, [[Chazz Princeton]], would win despite the unfair advantage in the Duel. Kaiba stated at the end that anyone who was a student at his academy should be able to win the Duel no matter what the disadvantage (in the dub, he stated that Slade and Jagger have a lot more to learn about world domination).<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!

One of the girls in the class says that they are one of the best looking, and another girl calls them dream boats.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!

(In the dub, Sartorius said that Kaiba hadn't aged in years. Kaiba then ordered his security men to keep an eye on Sartorius having suspicion on his scheme for using Kaiba Land.)<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|76|ref}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pegasus met [[Aster Phoenix]] at a party he listed Kaiba as one the best five Duelists he has ever met. He considered Kaiba to be the second greatest after Yugi.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!

One of the security men joked that they were going to have lunch with Seto Kaiba later on that day after they heard Crow say that he needed to see Bolten.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|94|ref}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n==Decks==\n{{main|Seto Kaiba's Decks}}\n\nKaiba's signature cards are his three \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]s\" and the [[Fusion Monster]] formed from the three dragons, the \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\", all of which serve as the key boss monsters to Kaiba's Decks throughout the series. His decks primarily rely on a [[Beatdown]] strategy to aggressively overwhelm his opponents with high-attack monsters. His cards are intended to be pugnacious, bellicose and vicious to reflect Kaiba's serious, stiff, and uptight personality.<ref>[http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/kids/news/story/0,28277,388900,00.html timeforkids.com] Kazuki Takahashi, ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' creator</ref> During [[Duelist Kingdom]], Kaiba's Magic and Trap cards supplement this strategy by disabling opposing monsters, such as \"[[Shadow Spell (anime)|Shadow Spell]]\" or \"[[Defense Paralysis]]\". Kaiba also uses a combo of \"[[Saggi the Dark Clown (anime)|Saggi the Dark Clown]]\" and \"[[Crush Card]]\", destroying all monsters in his opponent's Deck with more than 1500 ATK, further crippling their ability to defend against him.\n\nDuring [[Battle City]], Kaiba added \"[[Obelisk the Tormentor (anime)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]\" to his Deck, along with more [[Virus Cards]] like \"[[Giant Germ (anime)|Giant Germ\"]] and \"[[Virus Cannon (anime)|Virus Cannon]]\". He also began using Machine-type and Machine-type support cards such as the [[A-to-Z|XYZ]] [[Union monster]]s, \"[[Enemy Controller (anime)|Enemy Controller]]\" and \"[[Interdimensional Matter Transporter (anime)|Interdimensional Matter Transporter]]\", contrasting Kaiba's trust in technology against Yugi's Deck of mystical monsters like the \"[[Dark Magician (anime)|Dark Magician]]\". Kaiba continues to make use of his \"[[Crush Card Virus (later DM anime)|Crush Card Virus]]\" but instead of \"Saggi\" prefers \"[[Shrink (anime)|Shrink]]\" to weaken high powered monsters and Tribute them. Another combo he is fond of at this time is \"[[Ring of Destruction (anime)|Ring of Destruction]]\" and \"[[Ring of Defense (anime)|Ring of Defense]]\" to destroy enemy monsters and damage his opponent's [[Life Points]].\n\nIn ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]'', Kaiba adds the [[Pyramid of Light (anime)|Pyramid of Light]] to his Deck, using it to remove Yugi's [[Egyptian God Cards]] from play. He then depletes Yugi's Deck with a combo of \"[[Peten the Dark Clown (anime)|Peten the Dark Clown]]\" and \"[[Deck Destruction Virus]]\", and utilizes another enhanced form of his \"Blue-Eyes\", \"[[Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon]]\".\n\nWhile in the [[Noah's Virtual World|Virtual World]] Kaiba's Deck had a stronger focus on Dragon-[[Type]] monsters, adding \"[[Spear Dragon (anime)|Spear Dragon]]\", \"[[Different Dimension Dragon (anime)|Different Dimension Dragon]]\" and \"[[Thunder Dragon (anime)|Thunder Dragon]]\".\n\nIn [[Waking the Dragons]] Kaiba gained the \"[[Fang of Critias]]\". His Deck still focused on the \"Blue-Eyes\" and other Dragons, adding \"[[Paladin of White Dragon (anime)|Paladin of White Dragon]]\".\n\nAfter Waking the Dragons, Kaiba only Dueled twice more in the series, against [[Zigfried von Schroeder]] in the [[Grand Championship]], and later against [[Yami Bakura]]. Against Zigfried, Kaiba focused on removing his cards from play then returning them to the field with \"[[Dimension Fusion (anime)|Dimension Fusion]]\" in masses and using cards to regain Life Points such as \"[[Soul Absorption (anime)|Soul Absorption]]\" and \"[[Emergency Provisions (anime)|Emergency Provisions]]\" to counter the high costs of these cards. Kaiba also incorporates more dragons most notably the \"[[Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End (anime)|Chaos Emperor Dragon]]\" and uses its ability to devastate his opponent. He makes his duel finale against Yami Bakura, where he once again relies on his \"Blue-Eyes\" and uses cards seen in previous seasons to summon it to no avail as the duel is called off resulting in an undecided outcome.\n\n==Duels==\n{| class=\"wikitable card-list\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Opponent(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Episode(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Outcome\n|-\n| [[Solomon Muto]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 001|1]] || Win (off-screen)\n|-\n| [[Yugi Muto]]/[[Yami Yugi]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 001|1]] || Lose\n|-\n| [[Joey Wheeler]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 016|16]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Yugi Muto]]/[[Yami Yugi]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 022|22]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 024|24]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Maximillion Pegasus]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 026|26]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 027|27]] || Lose \n|-\n| [[Dueling Machine|Duel Robot]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 054|54]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Koji \"the Spider\" Nagumo|Koji Nagumo]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 060|60]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Rare Hunter 2]] and [[Rare Hunter 3]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 068|68]] || Win (with [[Yami Yugi]])\n|-\n| [[Lumis]] and [[Umbra]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 070|70]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 073|73]] || Win (with [[Yami Yugi]])\n|-\n| [[Ishizu Ishtar]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 093|93]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 094|94]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Leichter]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 108|108]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 109|109]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Noah Kaiba]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 114|114]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 116|116]] || Lose (taken over by [[Yami Yugi]], who won)\n|-\n| [[Gozaburo Kaiba]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 120|120]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 121|121]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Yami Marik]], [[Yami Yugi]], [[Joey Wheeler]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 122|122]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 124|124]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Yugi Muto]]/[[Yami Yugi]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 129|129]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 134|134]] || Lose\n|-\n| [[Joey Wheeler]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 135|135]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 137|137]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Alister]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 149|149]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 150|150]] || [[DRAW]]\n|-\n| [[Alister]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 166|166]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 167|167]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Dartz]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 177|177]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 182|182]] || Win (with [[Yami Yugi]]); Eliminated\n|-\n| [[Zigfried von Schroeder]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 194|194]]-[[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 195|195]] || Win\n|-\n| [[Yami Bakura]] || [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 200|200]] || No result\n|}\n\n==Other appearances==\n{{Character other appearances}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* Kaiba and his past counterpart [[Seto]] notably shared a similar troubled history with their father figure [[Gozaburo Kaiba]] and [[Aknadin]], respectively.\n** Both were raised by a manipulative father figure who wanted to make them their \"perfect\" successor, though their cruel method has turned their son against them.\n** Both were initially raised as an orphan, in Kaiba's case he was adopted by Gozaburo, wheas Seto was initially abandoned by his Aknadin for his own safety.\n** In the anime, both were defeated by \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\".

(anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime and the main antagonist of the [[Battle City]] and [[Battle City Quarterfinals]] arcs, until the defeat of [[Odion]], when Marik's alter ego [[Yami Marik]] takes over his body and replaces him as the main antagonist. He is the leader and founder of the [[Rare Hunters]] and heir to the [[Tomb Keeper]]s.\n\nMarik is the younger brother of [[Ishizu Ishtar]] and the adoptive younger brother of [[Odion]].\n\n== Design ==\n\n===Appearance===\n[[File:MalikConceptart.png|thumb|left|Marik linework.]]\nMarik's initial outfit consists of purple hooded robes with the [[Eye of Anubis]] on it, and a long purple cape with a gold chain at the front. He wears golden earrings, three bands of neckwear, an armband on each arm, and five bracelets on each arm starting from close to his elbows down to his wrists. He has dark skin, purple eyes and white-gold hair that occasionally appears as more light gray hair, especially in the Battle City tournament and at night.\n\nWhen he arrived in Domino City, he wore a sleeveless light purple hoodie with two gold chains on the front, black pants, and black shoes. While in [[Battle City]], he acquires a [[Duel Disk|KaibaCorp Duel Disk]] on his left arm. In the manga, his pants are beige, and he wears a black tank top underneath his hoodie, which would come to be the clothes his split personality would wear, minus the hoodie. \n\nWhen he was switched with Dark Marik as his sacrifice during his battle against Yami Yugi, he wears the outfit that Dark Marik wore but he removes the purple cloak before he destroys his dark self in the shadow game. \n\nThroughout Season 5, Marik eventually changed in a steel blue shirt with a black vest over it, two black and gold bracelets, light gray pants, and black shoes.  \n\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Personality===\nAs a child, Marik was an innocent boy who desired to see the outside world, despite his clan's laws forbidding him from doing so, and was willing to sneak out to fulfill his desire. He cared for his sister [[Ishizu Ishtar]] very much and also considered [[Odion]] to be his brother, despite not being blood related.\n\nMarik bore a grudge towards [[Pharaoh Atem|the Pharaoh]] because he was forced by [[Mr. Ishtar|his own father]] to guard the family's carving with his life via a ritual of having carvings (in the anime's Japanese version and the original manga) or tattoos (in the anime's dub) onto his back which brought intense pain during and after the ritual and robbed him of his freedom. \n\nWith the intense pain and his hatred towards the Pharaoh, he spawned his second personality [[Yami Marik]] to deal with it all. Such as a year later when his father brutally tortured Odion for helping Marik and Ishizu to sneak outside, Marik was unconscious while Yami Marik killed his father and woke up with no recollection of his father's murder. Immediately afterwards, he sees [[Shadi|a loyalist to the Pharaoh]], Shadi, had come to warn him about the dangerous path he had taken. Marik thought that Shadi had murdered his father, leading to Marik's betrayal of the clan to get revenge against the Pharaoh (this aspect is removed from the dub).\n\nWhile leading the [[Rare Hunters]] in his quest for world domination and freedom, Marik became cruel and uncaring, willing to brainwash people to do his bidding, force them to cheat, and use cruelty on his behalf, the victims included [[Bandit Keith]] and [[Strings]]. He was not above using death to punish his subordinates for failure despite them pleading to Marik they tried their best, such as [[Arkana]] and [[Lumis]], nor did he care about sacrificing Rare Hunters to test the fake \"[[The Winged Dragon of Ra (anime)|The Winged Dragon of Ra]]\" cards which produced severe injuries and death. He even threatened his sister Ishizu with the [[Millennium Rod]] for getting in his way and ordered Odion to use the fake Ra card against his will when was so close to winning against Joey. This may all stem from his other persona influencing him as when they met during Yami Marik's duel with Yami Bakura, the former said that he caused him to not feel guilty over his actions. Though He still retained his love for his family, despite his mistreatment of them.\n\n=== Etymology ===\nHis given name \"Marik\" is derived from the Arabic name [[wikipedia:Malik|Malik]] (مالك ''Mālik''), meaning \"owner\" or \"holder\". It was likely also influenced by the distinct Arabic title \"Malik\" (ملك ''Malik''), which means \"king\". The use of \"r\" rather than \"l\" comes from the two consonants being represented by the same speech sound in Japanese. He uses the name \"Malik\" in the Filipino and Indonesian versions.\n\nHis surname \"Ishtar\" comes from [[Wikipedia:Ishtar|Ishtar]], a [[Wikipedia:Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] goddess of fertility, love, war, and sex.\n\n==Biography==\n===History===\nMarik's family guarded the tomb of the Pharaoh for generations and two [[Millennium Items]] (the [[Millennium Rod]] and [[Millennium Necklace]]) were passed on to Marik and his sister [[Ishizu Ishtar]]. Marik was forbidden to leave the Pharaoh's tomb due to his [[Mr. Ishtar|father]]'s fear that the freedom and marvels of the outside world would further divert Marik's attention from his heritage. Marik no longer wanted to become a Tombkeeper, so his adoptive brother [[Odion Ishtar]] asked if he could take Marik's place but Marik's father rejected the thought of Odion taking Marik's place. When Marik was forced to take the initiation ritual to become a full Tombkeeper, Marik spawned his second personality [[Yami Marik]] from the pain he endured. A year later, Marik and Ishizu took a forbidden trip to the surface but their father found out and attempted punish Odion for not stoping Marik and Ishizu, by killing him. In the midst of his father's torturing Odion, Marik blanked out and his second personality Yami Marik emerged for the first time to resist his father's punishment and claimed the Millennium Rod for himself. Ignoring his father's orders to put it down, Yami Marik used its powers to smash him against the wall. When Ishizu protested, she suffered the same strike. Yami Marik then proceeded to kill his father. After Yami Marik was sealed away in Marik's body by Odion, Marik believed that the Pharaoh had ordered the loyalist [[Shadi]] to kill his father, due to Odion saying Shadi had killed him, trying to be a big brother and hiding from Marik that it was actually his alter ego who had done so. This increased Marik's grudge and resentment to the Pharaoh, causing him to create the Rare Hunters.\n\nAs a teenager, Marik was the leader of the [[Rare Hunters]] organization as he wished with the Millennium Rod to obtain the three [[Egyptian Gods|Egyptian God Cards]] so that he could unlock their power for himself, gain the title of \"Pharaoh\" and set his family free from the duty of the Tombkeepers (In the dub, he wants the God Cards and the Millennium Puzzle, so he can unlock the Pharaoh's power for himself and use it to rule the world). He also had a hidden agenda - to get revenge on the [[Yami Yugi|Nameless Pharaoh]]'s soul for killing his father as he mistakenly believed that it was the Pharaoh's fault. Although he and his Rare Hunters uncovered \"[[The Winged Dragon of Ra (anime)|The Winged Dragon of Ra]]\" and \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\" from where [[Maximillion Pegasus]] had hidden them, they were unable to uncover \"[[Obelisk the Tormentor (anime)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]\", which was taken by Ishizu and given to [[Seto Kaiba]].\n\n===Battle City===\nDuring [[Battle City]], Marik and his Rare Hunters hacked into Battle City's computer system and entered themselves in the tournament. After the Pharaoh defeated [[Seeker|the weakest Rare Hunter]], Marik used the Millennium Rod to take over the Rare Hunter's body to introduce himself to the Pharaoh. After the Pharaoh defeated [[Arkana]], Marik used the Millennium Rod to take over Arkana's body to introduce himself to [[Yugi Muto]]. While arriving at Domino City, Marik used the Millennium Rod to have [[Strings|a Rare Hunter]] use Slifer against the Pharaoh to win the Millennium Puzzle from him. Marik has a huge advantage up his sleeve,  with the Egyptian God Card \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\". Using a five card combo involving \"Slifer\", \"[[Revival Jam (anime)|Revival Jam]]\", \"[[Infinite Cards (anime)|Infinite Cards]]\", \"[[Jam Defender (anime)|Jam Defender]]\", and \"[[Card of Safe Return (anime)|Card of Safe Return]]\", Strings puts Yami in a tight situation. Every time he attacks, Strings can redirect the attack to \"Revival Jam\", which regenerates itself after being destroyed (this is neither an automatic nor immediate effect in the OCG/TCG) and thanks to \"Card of Safe Return\", he draws three cards from his Deck whenever this happens and because of \"Infinite Cards\", he can hold as many cards as he wants. With Slifer's ATK and DEF proportional to the number of cards its controller holds, and with \"Revival Jam\" able to absorb and reform from any attack Yugi is able to make with the aid of \"Jam Defender\", Marik boasts the strategy is unbeatable.\n\nYami is just about to give up until Kaiba arrives and encourages him to fight on. The two manage to figure out the weakness of this combo and turn it against Marik. Yami attacks \"Revival Jam\" with \"[[Buster Blader (anime)|Buster Blader]]\", and then uses \"[[Brain Control (anime)|Brain Control]]\" to take control of \"Revival Jam\" as it regenerates so it regenerates under his control, forcing \"Slifer\" to attack it with its second mouth. Then \"Revival Jam\" is destroyed and regenerates, forcing Strings to draw three more cards due to \"Card of Safe Return\". Then \"Slifer\" must attack \"Revival Jam\" again, since it reformed under Yami's control, destroying it and allowing it to regenerate again, and forcing Strings to continue drawing due to \"Card of Safe Return\". This continues in a never-ending loop until Strings' Deck is empty, and thus he loses the Duel through a Deck Out. Yami gets \"Slifer the Sky Dragon\" for his victory. When he was getting ready to brainwash Joey, [[Yami Bakura]] stood in his way, telling him to hand over the Rod. Instead, they made a deal where if Bakura obtains Slifer for him and defeat Yami Yugi, he would give him the Millennium Rod. Yami Bakura then stabbed himself in the arm and gave control back to his host, [[Bakura Ryou]]. He showed the injured Bakura to Joey, Solomon, and Téa, gaining their trust and taking the guise of Namu. While Kaiba and the Pharaoh Dueled [[Lumis and Umbra]], Marik used his Millennium Rod to brainwash [[Joey Wheeler]] and [[Téa Gardner]]. After Kaiba used Obelisk to defeat Umbra, Marik used the Millennium Rod to take over Lumis's body and brag about having Yugi's friends. Having a Rare Hunter hold Tea hostage, the deadly Duel between the Pharaoh and Joey went through much to Kaiba's horror. In the midst of the Duel, Yugi took over for the Pharaoh much to Marik's anger as he wanted to see the Pharaoh's demise not his teenage vessel's. When Marik forced Joey with the Millennium Rod's full power, Joey was able break free with his willpower.\n\nMarik, Bakura and Odion took places in the quarter-finals. Marik took the guise of Namu while Odion pretended to be \"Marik\" as nobody had actually met him in person and known his true name (sans Yami Bakura, since although Téa, Joey, and Bakura Ryou technically met him, he pretended to be a boy named Namu). After Bakura was defeated by the Pharaoh in the first quarter-final match, Marik had Odion use a counterfeit Ra card in his quarter-final against Joey. When Joey suspected that he was not Dueling the real Marik, as Odion had been Dueling with honor while Marik was cruel, sadistic and as by far as Joey was concerned, a dirty cheater; Marik ordered Odion to use the counterfeit Ra to \"show\" he's Marik but Ra was angered by this and wrathfully struck both Duelists with lightning, ultimately rendering Odion and Joey unconscious. After Joey defeated Odion, the latter reveals to the Pharaoh and Joey that he is really Marik's servant while Marik began to suffer sudden headaches. After Odion was further rendered unconscious, Marik revealed himself to the Pharaoh, Joey, Kaiba, Téa, [[Tristan Taylor]], [[Duke Devlin]], [[Mokuba Kaiba]], [[Serenity Wheeler]] and [[Mai Valentine]]. Suddenly, Marik cried out in pain as his darker personality gained control of his body. While Ishizu Dueled Kaiba in the fourth quarter-final match, Marik tried to call out to Ishizu but his dark personality trapped Marik in a \"prison\" built out of his own fear and pity. During his sister's Duel with Kaiba, the Millennium Rod began activating on its own, causing Yami Marik to wonder why; although Yami Marik had already taken control of him, there is a large possibility that Marik, by somehow knowing what was happening through his alter ego, wondered as well why Kaiba had a connection to his Rod. In the manga, one of Marik's goals before his darker personality awakened ''was'' to discover why the figure on the mural looked like Kaiba holding his Millennium Rod. Through Tea's mind, Marik listened to Ishizu's story of how he became evil and created his darker side, thus beginning to reform himself. After the quarter-finals, his reformed soul confronted his other self, claiming that he would make up for everything he had done and apologizing to his father, before a Duel with him. In this Duel, Marik teamed up with Yami Bakura to stop him, but failed when Yami Marik used Ra's other abilities, which were unknown to Marik. However, Marik (through Téa) warned Ishizu to hide Odion from Yami Marik in order to save his life.\n\n=== Battle City Finals ===\n[[File:Marik'sBack.jpg|thumb|200px|Marik's carving/tattoo of the Pharaoh's memory.]]\nIn the final Duel between Yami Marik and the Pharaoh, their weaker selves were the victims of the [[Shadow Game]] being played. As the Duel went on, Yami Marik became the dominant host of Marik's body while the real Marik's soul slowly faded out of existence. This Shadow Game gave him a clear edge, for when the Pharaoh lost [[Life Points]], Yugi's body would fade away, and when Yami Marik lost Life Points, the original Marik would fade away. As Marik realizes his mistakes of making people suffer, he speaks out through Téa, begging the Pharaoh for his forgiveness and asks him to defeat Yami Marik, even if it meant he would go to the Shadow Realm. While they Dueled, Odion woke up and made Marik realize he had to accept his responsibility for being a Tombkeeper. With this confidence, Marik overpowered his evil self and made him the victim of the Shadow Game, and then forfeited, destroying Yami Marik. Marik gave the Pharaoh the Millennium Rod and the Ra card.\n\nMarik then revealed the Tombkeeper's initiation. The carving of the pharaoh's memory onto the back of a tomb guardian (using either a hot dagger in the manga and the Japanese version of the second series anime, or a tattoo in the English second series anime although the dagger was still seen in the flashback) on his back. Fulfilling his duty as a Tombkeeper, Marik returned to Egypt to start a new life with his sister and Odion.\n\n===Pharaoh's Memories===\n[[File:Reformed marik.jpg|thumb|Marik's appearance in [[Dawn of the Duel]]]]\nIn the [[Pharaoh's Memories]] arc, Marik, Ishizu, and Odion lead Yugi and his friends to the Tablet of Memories, so Yami Yugi may enter the Memory World and regain his memory.\n\n=== Ceremonial Battle ===\nMarik, Ishizu, and Odion lead Yugi and his friends to the tomb of the Pharaoh in order for Yugi and [[Pharaoh Atem|Atem]] to have a final Duel in order to determine whether Atem will move on to the afterlife or remain in the present. Atem loses, allowing him to pass on to the afterlife. After he left, the Millennium Items sank into the ground and the tomb collapsed. Marik and the others managed to escape and Marik and his family end up staying in Egypt.\n\n{{clear}}\n==Other appearances==\n{{Character other appearances}}\n\n==Decks==\nMarik's own Deck is only shown once in a Duel, before Yami Marik modifies it prior to his second Duel. Marik himself uses several Decks while controlling the bodies of others through his [[Millennium Rod]]. \n\n===Through Keith===\nWhile controlling [[Bandit Keith]], he utilizes Keith's '''[[Machine]] Deck''', albeit modified to include powerful cards obtained by his [[Rare Hunter]]s, such as \"[[Zera the Mant (anime)|Zera the Mant]]\", \"[[Seiyaryu (anime)|Seiyaryu]]\" and \"[[Graceful Charity (anime)|Graceful Charity]]\".\n\n{{Decklist|Machine Deck\n|normal monsters =\n* [[Ground Attacker Bugroth (anime)|Ground Attack Bugroth]] x2<ref group=Notes name=hand2>The second copy can be seen in his hand after the first is [[Tribute]]d for \"[[Zera Ritual (anime)|Zera Ritual]]\" in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 051|episode 51]].</ref>\n* [[Mechanicalchaser (anime)|Mechancialchaser]]\n* [[Megasonic Eye (anime)|Megasonic Eye]]\n* [[Seiyaryu (anime)|Seiyaryu]]\n|effect monsters = \n* [[Cyber Jar (anime)|Cyber Jar]] \n* [[Machine King (anime)|Machine King]]\n|ritual monsters = \n* [[Zera the Mant (anime)|Zera the Mant]]\n|magic =\n* [[Curse of Fiend (anime)|Curse of Fiend]]\n* [[Graceful Charity (anime)|Graceful Charity]] \n* [[Machine Conversion Factory (anime)|Machine Conversion Factory]]\n* [[Stop Defense (anime)|Stop Defense]]\n* [[Tribute to the Doomed (anime)|Tribute to the Doomed]]\n* [[Zera Ritual (anime)|Zera Ritual]]\n|traps =\n* [[Magic Jammer (anime)|Magic Jammer]]\n* [[Solemn Judgment (anime)|Solemn Judgment]]\n}}\n\n===Through Strings===\nWhile controlling the body of [[Strings]], Marik uses a '''[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer]]/[[Slime]] Deck''' tooled to Summoning and powering up the [[Egyptian Gods|Egyptian God Card]] \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\" using a five-card combo known as the '''\"God Five\"''':\n\n* \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\": The main attack force with near infinite attack power.\n* \"[[Revival Jam (anime)|Revivial Jam]]\": The ultimate defense, to defend \"Slifer\" if necessary.\n* \"[[Jam Defender (anime)|Jam Defender]]\": To allow \"Revival Jam\" to automatically defend \"Slifer\".\n* \"[[Card of Safe Return (anime)|Card of Safe Return]]\": Every time \"Revival Jam\" is [[Special Summon]]ed from the [[Graveyard]], Strings must draw three cards, and \"Slifer\" gains 3000 ATK.\n* \"[[Infinite Cards (anime)|Infinite Cards]]\": Removes hand limit, allowing the ATK of \"Slifer\" to climb virtually infinite.\n\nThe sheer draw power of this deck ended up being its downfall, as Yami Yugi was able to create an infinite loop causing Strings to [[Deck Out]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Decklist|Slifer Deck\n|normal monsters =\n* [[Humanoid Slime (anime)|Humanoid Slime]] x2 <ref group=Notes name=hand1>A second copy can be seen in the anime after Strings drops his hand while Yami is explaining his infinite loop combo in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 057|episode 57]].</ref>\n* [[Slime King]]<ref group=Notes name=manga1>This card was only used in the manga.</ref>\n* [[Worm Drake (anime)|Worm Drake]] x2 <ref group=Notes name=hand1/>\n|effect monsters = \n* [[Revival Jam (anime)|Revival Jam]] \n* [[Slifer the Sky Dragon (anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\n|fusion monsters = \n* [[Humanoid Worm Drake (anime)|Humanoid Worm Drake]]\n|magic =\n* [[Card of Safe Return (anime)|Card of Safe Return]] x2\n* [[Infinite Cards (anime)|Infinite Cards]]\n* [[Jam Breeding Machine (anime)|Jam Breeding Machine]] x2\n* [[Nightmare's Steelcage (anime)|Nightmare's Steelcage]]\n* [[Polymerization (anime)|Polymerization]]<ref group=Notes name=artwork1>The artwork of this card was that of \"[[De-Fusion (anime)|De-Fusion]]\" in the dub.</ref>\n* [[Pot of Greed (anime)|Pot of Greed]]<ref group=Notes name=anime1>This card was only used in the anime.</ref>\n* [[Quick Attack]]\n|traps =\n* [[Jam Defender (anime)|Jam Defender]]\n}}\n\n===Through Joey===\nWhile controlling [[Joey Wheeler]], Marik plays a modified version of Joey's own Deck, which includes cards that are banned by [[Battle City Rules]], such as \"[[Hinotama (anime)|Hinotama]]\", \"[[Raigeki (anime)|Raigeki]]\" and \"[[Meteor of Destruction (anime)|Meteor of Destruction]]\".\n\n{{Decklist|Joey's Deck\n|normal monsters =\n* [[Alligator's Sword (anime)|Alligator's Sword]]\n|effect monsters = \n* [[Gearfried the Iron Knight (anime)|Gearfried the Iron Knight]] (in hand)\n* [[Panther Warrior (anime)|Panther Warrior]]\n* [[Rocket Warrior (anime)|Rocket Warrior]]\n|magic =\n* [[Attrition]]\n* [[Graceful Dice (anime)|Graceful Dice]]\n* [[Hinotama (anime)|Hinotama]] x3\n* [[Meteor of Destruction (anime)|Meteor of Destruction]]\n* [[Raigeki (anime)|Raigeki]]\n* [[Skull Dice (anime)|Skull Dice]]\n|traps =\n* [[Magical Arm Shield (anime)|Magical Arm Shield]]\n}}\n\n===As Yami Marik===\n{{main|Yami Marik#Deck}}\nYami Marik runs an '''Immortality-Torture Deck''', which focuses on slowly torturing his opponents and him watching them squirm.

Despite this being Solomon's Deck, Yugi never received his grandfather's \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\" that was part of the Deck as it was ripped in half by Seto Kaiba. Most of his Normal Monsters have low [[ATK]], but he supports them with [[Spell Card|Magic Card]]s such as \"[[Horn of the Unicorn (anime)|Horn of the Unicorn]]\" to raise their strength, while also maximizing his more powerful monsters' potential through cards like \"[[Burning Land (anime)|Burning Land]]\" and \"[[Makiu, the Magical Mist (anime)|Makiu, the Magical Mist]].\" If put on the defensive, he uses \"[[Swords of Revealing Light (anime)|Swords of Revealing Light]]\" and \"[[Magical Hats (anime)|Magical Hats]]\" to buy time for a comeback, or \"[[Mirror Force (anime)|Mirror Force]]\" and \"[[Spellbinding Circle (anime)|Spellbinding Circle]]\" for a surprise counterattack. He also includes a bit of support for his [[signature card]], \"[[Dark Magician (anime)|Dark Magician]]\", like \"[[Mystic Box (anime)|Mystic Box]]\" and \"[[Book of Secret Arts (anime)|Book of Secret Arts]]\". If all else fails, he resorts to Summoning mighty [[Ritual Monster]]s including \"[[Black Luster Soldier (anime)|Black Luster Soldier]]\" and \"[[Magician of Black Chaos (anime)|Magician of Black Chaos]]\" for a reversal finish. The Deck also had \"[[The Forbidden One]]\" cards in it, which he used in the first episode to defeat Kaiba, but [[Weevil Underwood]] threw them overboard on the ship to Duelist Kingdom, and [[Joey Wheeler]] was only able to recover two of them, so Yugi abandoned Exodia. When Yugi dueled [[Ghost Kaiba]], he used Monster Reborn to revive \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" to finish him off.\n\nYugi's Deck also has access to [[Fusion Monster]]s, such as \"[[Dragon Master Knight (anime)|Dragon Master Knight]]\" and \"[[Black Skull Dragon (anime)|Black Skull Dragon]]\".

ZEXAL]]'' anime. After the disappearance of [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]] and [[Rio Kastle|Marin]], Dumon assumed leadership of the five remaining Barian Emperors in an attempt to protect the Barian World from [[Astral]].<ref name=\"DurbeInfo\">{{citeweb|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/yugioh-zexal/images/chara_barian.png|title=TV Tokyo's Barian profile|publisher=tvtokyo.com}}</ref> He was later absorbed by Vector when attempting to protect Marin. He and the other Barian Emperors were revived and revert back into his true human self by the power of the [[Numeron Code]] following Yuma's and Astral's final Duel.\n\nDumon is the only Barian Emperor that never Dueled in his human form, or against [[Yuma Tsukumo]].\n\n==Design==\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Durbe's trueform.png|thumb|left|200px|Dumon's full appearance]]\nDumon appears most often under his gray cloak and has grey eyes that glows red. In his Barian form, his skin is of a wisteria color, he has short gray hair, two blue markings on the sides of his face and silver armor plating with blue gems covering different parts of his body, with a [[Barian Emblem]] found on the right side of his chest. Unlike most [[Barian]]s, he has a visible nose in his true form and his eyes are completely gray, with no visible pupils.\n[[File:HumanDurbe.jpg|thumb|Dumon's human form, using his comrade's name as an alias, \"[[Reginald Kastle|Nash]]\".]]\n[[File:DumonLineart.png|thumb|left|Line art of Dumon's human form.]]\nWhen on [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], his appearance is that of a bespectacled boy with short, gray spiky hair, wearing a black vest over a white shirt, black pants, a [[Baria Crystal (jewelry)|Baria Crystal]] on his right wrist and a scarf tied around his neck. He would also come to use his former comrade's name, [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]], as his alias when in human form.<ref name=\"ep99\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|99|ref}}</ref> Following his revival after [[Yuma Tsukumo]] and [[Astral]]'s ceremonial Duel, Dumon attends [[Heartland Academy]] as a third-year student, thus wearing the standard blue-lined uniform, blue pants and brown shoes.\n\nIn in his previous life, Dumon was a legendary knight and accordingly wore silver armor with a white cape. Unlike the human form that he took on in present-day Earth, Dumon did not wear spectacles.\n\n===Personality===\nAmong his allies, Dumon is shown to be the most level-headed among them and was at one time their leader. He is shown to care about his fellow [[Barian]]s greatly, often voicing his high opinion of them and usually letting them know that he has faith in them before seeing them off on their mission.<ref name=\"ep74\" /><ref name=\"ep80\" /> Dumon is very loyal to the [[Barian World]] and prioritizes its safety above all else. Likewise, he is extremely loyal to the original leader of the Barian World, [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]], going to great lengths to find and restore him to his original position within the [[Seven Barian Emperors]]. This appears to have stemmed from their previous human lives.\n\nDumon is also shown to intimidate the other Barians, especially [[Alito]], whom complained about the mission he received, but complied when Dumon used a strict tone.<ref name=\"ep80\" /> He also seems to dislike confrontation as he often puts an end to arguments and fights between his comrades<ref name=\"ep74\" /><ref name=\"ep94\" /><ref name=\"ep99\" />, though this did not stop him from threatening to put an end to [[Vector]] with his own hands if the latter did not stop acting alone.<ref name=\"ep94\" /> He is not averse to praising his enemies, as he did during his Duel with [[Reginald Kastle|Shark]], where he complimented the young man's determination and Dueling skills.<ref name=\"ep97\" />\n\nHe was also willing to sacrifice his life in order to protect his comrades, as seen when he was trying to used his \"[[Celestial Rage]]\" to end his last Duel against Vector in a draw, as well as using \"[[Sacred Shield]]\" to protect [[Rio Kastle|Marin]], even though it meant his death.<ref name=\"ep132\" />\n===Etymology===\nDumon's name is derived from [[wikipedia:Alpha Ursae Majoris|Alpha Ursae Majoris]], also known as Dubhe, a star located in the [[wikipedia:Big Dipper|Big Dipper]] asterism. His alias in human form, \"Nash\" is derived from another star in the same asterism - [[wikipedia:Eta Ursae Majoris|Eta Ursae Majoris]], also known as Benetnasch.\n\n===Abilities===\n[[File:Durbe'sEnergyForm.png|left|200px|thumb|Dumon's energy ball.]]\nDumon, like the other [[Barian]]s, has been shown to teleport using portals. Dumon has also been shown to generate a large [[energy ball]] which he can use to fly. Dumon is one of the few Barians who can stay in his true form, even on [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] (though he was in close proximity to [[Number ruins]] at the time). The only exception is when his [[Baria Lapis]] is damaged.<ref name=\"ep108\" />\n\n==Biography==\n===History===\n[[File:DurbePastLife.jpg|thumb|right|Dumon as a knight in his previous life.]]\nLong ago, Dumon was a knight who served to protect a kingdom he lived in along with his pegasus, [[Mach]].<ref name=\"ep100\" /> He was friends with the ruler of the [[United Lands of the Poseidon Ocean]], [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]]. When Nash's kingdom was attacked by [[Vector]]'s [[Vector's army|forces]], Dumon arrived to assist. He was targeted by Vector's archers, but he and his pegasus were too quick to be hit by the arrows. Nash's sister [[Rio Kastle|Marin]] was taken by the ocean god that Vector Summoned, [[Abyss (character)|Abyss]]. Dumon attempted to save her, but Marin pitched herself from Abyss' hand, sacrificing herself to call forth another [[Number 94: Crystalzero (character)|another god]].<ref name=\"ep109\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|109|ref}}</ref> Dumon then stood by Nash's side as he mourned his sister's death. He then assisted Nash's army in assaulting Vector's once more. The assault led them to a town Vector ravaged on his way, which sickened Dumon as he allowed his people to live in such conditions.<ref name=\"ep119\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|119|ref}}</ref> As the war between the two kings prolonged, Dumon and Nash planned to confront Vector and his military once they reached his location. Dumon fought and lead Nash's army in the battle and was the only known survivor.<ref name=\"ep120\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|120|ref}}</ref> At one point in his life, Dumon obtained a card called \"[[Number 44: Sky Pegasus (anime)|Number 44: Sky Pegasus]]\".<ref name=\"ep140\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|140|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Durbe'sMemories.png|left|200px|thumb|Dumon's fellow knights moves to kill him due to [[Don Thousand]]'s influence.]]\nEventually, he returned to his homeland, but learned about how his fellow knights had grown arrogant and plotted to usurp the King. Dumon and Mach intercepted the other knights and tried to reason with them, but Dumon failed and the knights turned their swords on him. Since Dumon was unwilling to kill his former comrades, both master and steed were eventually defeated and killed. However, Dumon's fellow knights regretted their actions and they buried him and Mach together.<ref name=\"ep100\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|100|ref}}</ref> The knights had been hyponotized by [[Don Thousand]] in an effort to cause Dumon's rebirth as a [[Barian]].<ref name=\"ep140\" /> \n\n[[File:Barian World beings.jpg|thumb|right|Dumon along with [[Alito]], [[Mizar]], and [[Girag]].]]\n\nAn unknown number of years later, Thousand reincarnated him as one of the [[Seven Barian Emperors]], as his soul was one that was connected to a [[Mythyrian Numbers|Mythyrian \"Numbers\"]] card, which had sealed Thousand's power.<ref name=\"ep129\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|129|ref}}</ref> Dumon had no memory of his previous life, due to the \"[[Number 10X|Over-Hundred Number]]\" that he received from Don Thousand.<ref name=\"ep130\" /> After their leader, Nash's disappearance, Dumon assumed command of the Barians.<ref name=\"DurbeInfo\" /> The Emperors plotted to obtain the [[Numeron Code]] before [[Astral]] by gathering the \"[[Number]]s\".<ref name=\"ep74\" /> Due to both worlds being made of energy, they could not interact, so they could not take \"Numbers\" directly.<ref name=\"ep74\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|74|ref}}</ref> After [[Vector]]'s plan of using humans such as [[Vetrix]] and [[Dr. Faker]] failed, Dumon determined they would have to intervene themselves.<ref name=\"ep73\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|73|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II===\n====Barian Invasion====\nWith the defeat of both [[Vetrix]] and [[Dr. Faker]], as well as the supposed death of [[Vector]], Dumon determined that they would have to accomplish the mission themselves. To that end, he sent [[Girag]] to [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], who began the new plan by brainwashing [[Fender]] and his subordinates as their first new agents.<ref name=\"ep74\" />\n\n[[File:Alit leaving for earth.jpg|thumb|left|Dumon sending [[Alito]] to Earth after [[Girag]]'s failure]]\n\nFollowing Girag's failed attempts to acquire the \"[[Number]]s\", Dumon began to feel frustrated at the lack of good results and summoned [[Alito]]. Dumon ordered Alito to gather the \"Numbers\", however Alito rejected the mission as he claimed he could not fight to his fullest nor maintain his true form on Earth and that it would be boring. Dumon's eyes glowed, which intimidated Alito enough to make him go. [[Mizar]] appeared shortly afterwards, questioning Dumon on his reasons to send a \"simpleton\" like Alito to gather the \"Numbers\" as the future of the [[Barian World]] depended on it. Dumon merely responded that despite his flaws, he's an excellent [[Duelist]] and should have no trouble and that even a failure would bring them more information.<ref name=\"ep80\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|80|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Durbe hands over the Barian Sphere Cubes.png|thumb|right|Dumon hands [[Mizar]] the [[Barian Sphere Cube]]s.]]\n\nAfter the constant failures of Girag and [[Alito]], Dumon decided to send Mizar to Earth in order to Duel [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma]]. He gave him three [[Barian Sphere Cube]]s, two of which he was to give to Girag and Alito. Dumon put full trust in him, hoping he would produce better results than the other two.<ref name=\"ep82\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|82|ref}}</ref> Later, Dumon and Mizar looked after a comatose Girag and Alito, who were healing in [[Baria Crystal]]s. Dumon remarked that only he and Mizar remained. It was then that Vector appeared to them, surprising them. When Mizar angrily tried to attack Vector, Dumon restrained him and told Mizar to calm down. Dumon blamed Vector for his failure, but Vector claimed his plan went exactly as it should have - up to and including his loss while possessing Faker. The three discussed what to do next, with Dumon ultimately agreeing to let Vector proceed as he planned, but warned him to stop acting on his own.<ref name=\"ep94\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|94|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shark vs. Durbe.png|thumb|left|Shark vs. Dumon.]]\nVector's plan eventually resulted in Yuma, Astral and their allies boarding the [[Different Dimension Airship]] and attempting to reach the [[Barian World]] to rescue \"Ray Shadows\". The Barians sent monsters after the ship, and though the occupants fought them off, the ship crashed at \"[[Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield (anime)|Sargasso the Different Dimension Battlefield]]\", where Dumon waited with Vector and Mizar. Dumon took on [[Reginald Kastle]] and allowed him the first [[turn]], and then watched his opponent take [[effect damage|damage]] from the [[card effect|effect]] of \"Sargasso\".<ref name=\"ep95\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|95|ref}}</ref> As the Duel continued, Dumon managed to [[Xyz Summon]] \"[[Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry (anime)|Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry]]\" as well as protect himself from \"Sargasso\" using \"[[Sargasso Lighthouse (anime)|Sargasso Lighthouse]]\".<ref name=\"ep96\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|96|ref}}</ref> Seeing how skilled Shark was after he Summoned \"[[Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss (anime)|Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss]]\", Dumon complimented him, and stated Shark's way of speaking and soul reminds him of a certain person.<ref name=\"ep97\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|97|ref}}</ref> As Vector and Yuma's Duel reached its climax, Dumon neglected his own Duel to watch theirs and questioned Shark about Yuma, for he was interested in how much the former believed in the boy. After the power surge of [[ZEXAL II]] caused \"Sargasso\" to self-destruct, Dumon was forced to cancel his Duel with Shark and retreat back to the Barian World.<ref name=\"ep98\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|98|ref}}</ref>\n\n====Mythyrian Numbers War====\n[[File:DurbeandSharktrapped.png|right|200px|thumb|Dumon and [[Reginald Kastle|Shark]] trapped by the ruins.]]\nBack in the [[Barian World]], Dumon and [[Mizar]] saw that their home was crumbling around them and took it as sign that their time was ending. When [[Vector]] appeared, Dumon learned of the seven [[Mythyrian Number|Mythyrian \"Numbers\"]] and got their locations from [[Mr. Heartland]]. Dumon was about to set out, but Vector mentioned that [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]] might still be alive in the human world and he might be able to find him. Dumon then left through a portal, determined to collect the \"[[Number]]s\" first, but also wanting to look for Nash. As Dumon traveled through the dimensional rifts, he thought about Nash and lamented how Nash would never let similar events to their current situation happen. He eventually crashed into the [[Different Dimension Airship]], causing both him and the airship to exit the rift around one of the desired locations. Dumon woke up in his human form, injured from the crash and saw that his [[Baria Crystal (jewelry)|Baria Crystal]] was damaged - making him unable to use his [[Barian]] powers - and was about to be attacked by a bear. He then gained a debilitating arm injury. He was surprised when [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma]] suddenly saved him from it. Upon their meeting, [[Reginald Kastle|Shark]] questioned who he was. Dumon said that his name was \"Nash\" and he was on vacation. Even though neither Yuma nor Shark recognized him as Dumon, Shark was still suspicious. Shark tried to convince Yuma not to trust him, but this conversation was cut short after the group heard [[Tori Meadows]]' scream from some distance way. They arrived at a temple and reunited with [[Rio Kastle]] and Tori Meadows (after getting rid of some snakes). In one room, Dumon saved Shark from being crushed by a wall coming down, but they got separated from the others. When a door opened up, Dumon and Shark went into the path, leading them to an empty room. Shark thanked Dumon for the rescue, but said he still didn't trust him. Dumon shrugged it off and he did it in return for Yuma saving him. When the walls started to close in, they were captured and their lives depended on the outcome of Yuma's Duel with [[Mach]].<ref name=\"ep99\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|99|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:ZXx100 Durbe saves Shark.png|thumb|200px|left|Dumon saves Shark from falling.]]\n\nDumon and Shark were forced to work together to survive the collapsing and changing labyrinth. Following [[Astral]]'s instructions, Dumon read the inscriptions on the walls of the ruins, which told of a legendary hero and his Pegasus. The legend stirred a feeling in Dumon, who believed that something was familiar about the legend. Although some of the runes were faded, Dumon knew how the story ended and the message behind it: Protect your friends. When the floor collapsed, Dumon saved Shark from death. When their hands touched, Shark began to glow and Dumon's Baria Crystal was repaired. Revealing himself and [[Barian Battlemorph|transforming]], Dumon pulled Shark up to safety. With the information from the legend, Dumon advised Yuma to protect his \"[[Number 39: Utopia (anime)|Number 39: Utopia]]\", which helped him defeat Mach's \"[[Number 44: Sky Pegasus (anime)|Number 44: Sky Pegasus]]\". Yuma thanked him for his assistance, but Dumon insisted was that they would be enemies the next time they met and after that he teleported away.<ref name=\"ep100\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|100|ref}}</ref>\n\nLater, Vector called Dumon and Mizar back to the Barian World and informed that Alito and Girag had awoken, much to their surprise. He was also stunned by Alito's new arrogant attitude towards him, but their conversation was cut off when Mr. Heartland interrupted them. Heartland told the group of the new \"Number\" location and that Yuma might be aiming for it as well, and Dumon looked on as Alito left to retrieve it.<ref name=\"ep103\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|103|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DurbeconfrontsYuma.png|right|200px|thumb|Dumon confronting [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma]].]]\n\nLater, Dumon pondered over the connection between the seven \"Numbers\" and the [[Seven Barian Emperors]]. When Mizar arrived to inform him that he found another [[Number ruins]], Dumon lamented how they lost most of the \"Numbers\" to Astral and his group. Dumon then shared to Mizar his conclusion about the ruins' legends implied that they were humans once, but Mizar refused to believe this and left Dumon in search of the \"Number\".<ref name=\"ep105\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|105|ref}}</ref> Some time later, Dumon met with Mizar again and Mizar confirmed that the \"Number\" spirit had said he was once human, though Mizar refused to believe it. Dumon claimed he couldn't believe it either, but wished to continue investigating the ruins to find the legends of Nash and Marin, as their return could shift the situation to the Barians' advantage. Dumon arrived at the Different Dimension Airship and found out from Tori that the rest of the group had gone underwater. Dumon followed and eventually met up with Yuma and Astral.<ref name=\"ep108\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|108|ref}}</ref>\n\nDumon challenged Yuma to a Duel to settle things, insisting it was their destiny to battle, but Yuma asked why he wanted to even there was no real reason to fight and Dumon helped them in the past. Dumon told Yuma that he was wrong and claimed he did not believe the legends that told the Barians were once human. When Astral asked Dumon why the final two Barian Emperors had not shown up yet, he told him that Nash and Marin were the leaders, but they vanished some time ago. Seeing Shark's Duel with [[Abyss (character)|Abyss]] in progress, Dumon left to watch it and was able to view the memories of Shark's past life. Dumon expressed surprise upon seeing that he was friends with Shark as well as seeing the [[Barian Emblem]] around Shark's neck. Upon Shark's summoning of the [[Number 94: Crystalzero (character)|second god]], Dumon began to suspect that Shark and Rio were Nash and Marin as he left the ruins.<ref name=\"ep109\" />\n\nWhile Yuma journeyed through the Astral World, Dumon had a brief talk with Mizar again, concerning the past life matter. He concluded that there was no way around it and that they must have had previous lives. He then appeared in Rio's hospital room, where Shark was, shocking the latter by calling him \"Nash\", expressing his theory that Shark is Nash.<ref name=\"ep118\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|118|ref}}</ref> He then used a [[Barian Emblem]] to take Shark and Rio to the undersea ruins once more where Shark witnessed another more of his past life's memories.<ref name=\"ep119\" /> Shortly Shark saw how his past life's war with Vector ended, Dumon appeared before Shark along with Rio in form of an apparition. The Barian Emperor told Shark that he had finally understood why Shark was reborn as the leader of the Barians.<ref name=\"ep120\" /> Dumon transported Shark and Rio to the Barian World to meet Nash's army and [[Iris]]. He told Shark that the war with [[Astral World]] will continue until one side is destroyed. He stated that Shark was the only one who could end it, even if it meant breaking his bond with Yuma and his friends, calling him \"Nash\" and Rio \"Marin\".<ref name=\"ep121\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|121|ref}}</ref>\n\nA meeting was called and all the Barian Emperors gathered. Dumon looked on as Vector expressed his shock that Nash and Marin were alive.<ref name=\"ep122\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|122|ref}}</ref> Dumon explain to Vector that they ended up Earth as the Kastle twins, with their memories gone. He went on to ask Vector if the current situation on Earth was his doing, since only [[Don Thousand]] would be able to merge the worlds, but Vector suggested that [[Mr. Heartland]] must have revived him. After Nash granted each of the Barian Emperors new powers, he then consented to Vector's plan of attacking Earth now.<ref name=\"ep123\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|123|ref}}</ref>\n\n====Barian Emperor Onslaught====\n[[File:Dumon Vs. Dextra.png|thumb|left|Dumon vs. [[Dextra]].]]\nAfter [[Mr. Heartland]] was defeated, the [[Seven Barian Emperors]] arrived together on [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] in front of [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma]] and commenced [[Barian Battlemorph]]. After Yuma was rendered unable to Duel when the [[Emperor's Key]] reacted with Nash's [[Barian Emblem]], [[Roku]] and [[Kaze]] arrived and pelted the Emperors with smoke bombs, allowing Yuma's group to escape. The Emperors gave chase, with Dumon being confronted by [[Dextra]], who he recognized as the \"wench\" that [[Vetrix]] had Dueled during the [[World Duel Carnival]]. As the Duel went on, he called her a stubborn opponent as she claimed he had yet to see her true ability. Eventually, [[Nash]] led the Emperors in a [[Chaos Draw]].<ref name=\"ep124\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|124|ref}}</ref> This allowed Dumon to use \"[[Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One (anime)|Rank-Up-Magic - The Seventh One]]\" to bring out \"[[Number C102: Archfiend Seraph (anime)|Number C102: Archfiend Seraph]]\". As he defeated Dextra with it, he complimented her and told her to rest now as her soul was sent to the [[Barian World]].<ref name=\"ep125\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|125|ref}}</ref> After Nash's victory over [[Quattro]], the Emperors regrouped and Dumon commented that the other remaining \"Number\" holders were Yuma, Astral, [[Kite Tenjo|Kite]], [[Trey]] and [[Quinton]]. Nash ordered the Emperors to split up and pursue them.<ref name=\"ep126\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|126|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DurbeandMeragEnergyBeams.png|right|200px|thumb|Dumon and [[Rio Kastle|Marin]] head towards a Duel.]]\nDumon traveled with [[Rio Kastle|Marin]] and they were soon alerted to a Duel's start when they saw \"[[Number 9: Dyson Sphere]]\" in the sky. They quickly headed to that location to find [[Mizar]] Dueling Trey and Quinton. Mizar told them he was fine and that they should move on and pursue Yuma and Kite. Trey and Quinton then used the power of their bracelets' [[crest]]s to generate a [[Sphere Field]], trapping the three Barians there. Mizar still told them not to interfere, which they obeyed and continued to watch they Duel.<ref name=\"ep127\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|127|ref}}</ref> After the brothers managed to seal \"The Seventh One\" by equipping Mizar's \"[[Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon (anime)|Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]\" to \"[[Number C6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis (anime)|Number C6: Chronomaly Chaos Atlandis]]\", Dumon commented that \"The Seventh One\" should be unstoppable, with Marin adding they had indeed found its one weakness. He was shocked when they managed to reduce Mizar's Life Points to only 1 with \"Chaos Atlandis\". Mizar finally manged to recover \"Tachyon Dragon\" and Summon \"[[Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon (anime)|Number C107: Neo Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon]]\" to defeat them. The Sphere Field faded and Mizar told Dumon and Marin that he was heading to the moon to find Kite, after hearing of the [[Legend of the Dragons of Light and Time|legend]] the latter had gone to investigate.<ref name=\"ep128\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|128|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vector Vs Merag & Dumon.png|thumb|left|200px|Dumon and [[Rio Kastle|Marin]] take on [[Vector]].]]\nWhen Dumon and Marin arrived in the Barian World, they were greeted by Vector. He informed them he intended to unite the power of the Seven Emperors. Dumon responded that the seven were already united, but Vector corrected him, saying he would absorb all of their powers for himself.<ref name=\"ep130\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|130|ref}}</ref> Vector revealed that he had revived Don Thousand and that the Seven Emperors were simply his pawns to begin with. Dumon pointed out that that applied to Vector too, but Vector claimed that with Thousand's power, he was a god himself. Dumon suggested Marin flee to inform the others, but Vector clarified that Alito and Girag were working for him. The three Dueled in a [[Battle Royal]] style, though Marin and Dumon combined \"[[Number 103: Ragnazero (anime)|Number 103: Ragnazero]]\" and \"[[Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry (anime)|Number 102: Star Seraph Sentry]]\" to destroy \"[[Number 96: Dark Mist (anime)|Number 96: Dark Mist]]\". However, Vector Summoned \"[[Number 43: Manipulator of Souls (anime)|Number 43: Manipulator of Souls]]\" and equipped \"Dark Mist\" to it before recovering his [[Life Points]] using the [[Continuous Spell Card]] \"[[Don Thousand's Throne (anime)|Don Thousand's Throne]]\", which drew its power from [[Reginald Kastle|Nash]], who is held captive within a [[Sphere Field]], which in turn increased the monster's [[ATK]] and deals damage to Marin. [[File:Dumon'sfinalmoments.png|right|200px|thumb|Dumon falls, hoping his sacrifice will enable Marin to win.]] Vector revealed his \"point\" system and the fact that he had killed Nash and Marin previously. Marin, enraged by Vector's words, used \"The Seventh One\" to bring out \"[[Number C103: Ragnafinity (anime)|Number C103: Ragnafinity]]\".<ref name=\"ep131\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|131|ref}}</ref> Dumon nearly defeated Vector and himself with \"[[Celestial Rage]]\" and \"Archfiend Seraph\", but he was countered by \"[[Evil 1]]\". Using \"[[Sacred Shield]]\", he increased the ATK of Marin's \"Ragnafinity\" and took himself out of the Duel, expressing his thanks to Marin and Nash for being his friends in both lives. He reverted to his human form and faded away, his soul being absorbed into Marin.<ref name=\"ep132\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|132|ref}}</ref> Despite Dumon's sacrifice, Marin was unable to win, as \"Don Thousand's Throne\" enabled Vector to [[Rank-Up]] \"Manipulator of Souls\" into \"[[Number C43: High Manipulator of Chaos (anime)|Number C43: High Manipulator of Chaos]]\", which defeated Marin. Vector absorbed Marin's soul afterwards, gaining Dumon's in the process.<ref name=\"ep133\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!

ZEXAL|136|ref}}</ref> During Nash's Duel with Yuma, Dumon's soul appeared to support Nash alongside those of the other Emperors after Nash overlaid their \"[[Number C10X|Chaos Over-Hundred Numbers]]\" to create \"[[CXyz Barian Hope (anime)|CXyz Barian Hope]]\".<ref name=\"ep142\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|142|ref}}</ref>\n[[File:Dumonhuman.png|thumb|right|100px|Dumon as a third year student at Heartland Academy.]]\nLike the rest of the Emperors, Dumon was later revived by the power of the Numeron Code and revert back into his true human form. He enrolled in [[Heartland Academy]] as a third-year student.
