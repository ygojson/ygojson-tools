ARC-V]]'' anime. It aired in Japan on December 25th, 2016, and in Australia on March 18, 2018.\n\n{{episode summary|Right before [[Declan Akaba|Declan]] and the others, who believe that [[Yuya Sakaki|Yuya]]'s Dueling will bring peace to the world... [[Z-ARC]] is finally awakened. Z-ARC proclaims that the feelings of those who believe in Yuya have helped him be revived. The [[Lancers]]' battle against Z-ARC, who uses his overwhelming power to bring despair to all, has just begun.}}\n\n==Summary==\n<!--\"Supreme King Z-ARC\" appears across dimensional tears.-->\n[[Z-ARC|Supreme King Z-ARC]], still shrouded in shadow, roars, his visage appearing in portals to the [[Four Dimensions]]. [[Chojiro Tokumatsu]], carrying groceries, asks what it is from the [[Synchro Dimension]] and realizes it likely isn't a mirage, while [[Shinji Weber]] wonders from his [[Duel Runner]] if this has something to do with the [[Dimensional War]] that Yuya mentioned. The [[Duel Academy (ARC-V)|Duel Academy]] students assisting in rebuilding [[Heartland City (ARC-V)|Heartland City]] in the [[Xyz Dimension]] are speechless, and [[Alan]] asks what Z-ARC is, [[Saya Sasayama|Saya]] wondering if it's a Duel Monster. Z-ARC even appears above the [[You Show Duel School]], where [[Skip Boyle]] consoles [[Tate]], [[Allie]] and [[Frederick]]. [[Henrietta Akaba]] spots Z-ARC from the top of the [[Leo Corporation]] office, wondering if this is the scenery of another dimension.\n\n<!--Riley runs away, claiming to have heard Ray.-->\nSupreme King Z-ARC towers over the [[Fusion Dimension]], declaring his name and reunification as one. [[Declan Akaba|Declan]] wonders where Z-ARC is, believing he has to have Summoned \"Supreme King Z-ARC\" from somewhere, and [[Aster Phoenix (ARC-V)|Aster]] and [[Sora Perse|Sora]] both look around as well. Looming over dozens of Duel Academy students, Z-ARC asks the humans if they've lost their nerves even though he has been revived just as they wished. An [[Obelisk Blue]] student asks what Z-ARC is talking about, a [[Slifer Red]] agreeing they didn't wish for this, but Z-ARC orders them to be silent, claiming that humans created him and he won't allow them to deny so now. He breathes a spear of energy from his jaws, striking a nearby archway and shaking the Academy, while Aster and Sora react with shock at the notion they created Z-ARC. A pink streak of realization strikes [[Riley Akaba|Riley]] and Declan bends to take Riley's hand. Riley protests that [[Leo Akaba|their father]] is still inside, but Declan reassures Riley that the Professor is a cautious man and will have already evacuated to somewhere safe. But Riley disagrees, claiming to have heard [[Ray Akaba|Ray]] calling out to their father, much to Declan's surprise, Riley claiming that Ray is asking to be quickly revived and screaming that she is the only one who can defeat Z-ARC. Riley runs off, and Declan sprints after his sibling, calling for Riley to wait, but Aster and Sora don't follow, Aster suggesting they look for Z-ARC, and Sora agrees.\n\n<!--The Professor wonders why Ray hasn't revived.-->\nIn the [[ARC-V Reactor]], the Professor's platform drifts closer and he works urgently at a virtual keyboard, desperately asking why Ray hasn't revived. His lens over his eye, he wonders if the life energy he provided was insufficient after all and screams Ray's name.\n\nSupreme King Z-ARC continues to lay waste to the [[City (Fusion Dimension)|City]] below him, asking if anyone will try to defeat him and demanding a Duel. Aster and Sora rush to the edge of a platform, shocked at the destruction and Aster wonders if this was the result of the [[Arc Project]]: the project intended to realize the Professor's intended vision of an ideal world has instead produced a devil, casting the world into ruin. As the Commander of Duel Academy's Xyz Expeditionary Force, Aster believes he has to take responsibility for the situation, and as Sora pops a lollipop into his mouth, Aster asks him once again if he'll help him. Sora turns away and refuses, but claims he'd be willing to entertain the idea of ''Aster'' helping him, then offers him a lollipop.\n\n[[File:Zarc appears.png|left|thumb|250px|[[Z-ARC]] appears for the first time]]\nA group of people flee the destruction, Supreme King Z-ARC cuts them off, telling the foolish humans to teel themselves and fight him, then die until the day that only one remains, until the entire world is destroyed. He breathes another column of energy at them, but it's blocked just in time by \"[[Destiny HERO - Decider (anime)|Destiny HERO - Decider]]\", surrounded by a blue energy sphere, and Aster and Sora get between Z-ARC and the people, Aster declaring they'll face him. Sora tells Z-ARC to stop hiding and show himself already, and Supreme King Z-ARC dissolves into smoke, bemused at finally finding some prey. The smoke crackles with red lightning and gathers in front of them, before dispersing to reveal Z-ARC in humanoid form. Sora comments that Z-ARC is finally showing himself, a claim that confuses Z-ARC, who points out that he's been in front of them all along. Z-ARC's body is now that of [[Yuya Sakaki|Yuya]], but with grey gargoyle-like features and skin and warped black wings, his eyes glowing yellow. Aster asks if he isn't Yuya, but a monster fused with a human, and Sora demands to know where Yuya is and whether Z-ARC is controlling him. Z-ARC claims this is who he is, and Yuya was nothing more than an avatar to enable his revival, and he's gone now. Aster and Sora are shocked by Z-ARC's claim, and Z-ARC adds that they'll be the first two sacrifices to the extinction of humanity, suggesting they be proud of this. He activates Yuya's [[Duel Disk]], now with a green outline at one end of the dragon head-shaped blade, and Aster and Sora do likewise, all three calling \"Duel!\"\n\n<!--Z-ARC Pendulum Summons.-->\nZ-ARC declares his [[turn]] and [[Draw a card|draws]], telling them to bear witness to the original and ultimate, mastering both right and might, and power without peer, ordering them to let it burn into their eyes. He sets the [[Pendulum Scale]] with the [[Pendulum Scale 0 Monster Cards|Scale 0]] \"[[Supreme King Gate Zero (anime)|Supreme King Gate Zero]]\" and the [[Pendulum Scale 13 Monster Cards|Scale 13]] \"[[Supreme King Gate Infinity (anime)|Supreme King Gate Infinity]]. The rainbow-colored letters spell out \"PENDULUM\" as the two grim-faced symbols rise in the [[Pendulum Zone]]s, Z-ARC explaining that he can now Summon monsters from [[Level 1 Monster Cards|Level 1]] to [[Level 12 Monster Cards|12]] simultaneously, and Aster is shocked to see Z-ARC using [[Pendulum Monster]]s, while Sora asks if they're really a Scale 0 and 13. Z-ARC declares a [[Pendulum Summon]], ordering his servants to gather to him - two \"[[Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm (anime)|Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm]]s\". He ends his turn, though Aster is still shocked that Z-ARC is using Pendulum Monsters and Sora believes that has to be proof that Yuya still exists within Z-ARC. Aster agrees that even though the devil Duelist has taken over Yuya's body, Yuya Sakaki's spirit still remains deep within his heart, declaring his belief in this truth.\n\n<!--\"Darkwurm\" phases to avoid the attack of \"Dystopia\".-->\nHe declares his turn and draws, then [[activate]]s the [[Spell Card]] \"[[Polymerization (anime)|Polymerization]]\" from his hand, [[Fusion Material|fusing]] \"Destiny HERO - Decider\" and \"[[Destiny HERO - Drilldark (anime)|Destiny HERO - Drilldark]]\" from his hand and [[Summon chants in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|chanting]] \"Hero who decides the fate of victory. Her who pierces the bedrock of destiny. Become one now, and reign over a future of darkness! [[Fusion Summon]]! Come on! [[Destiny HERO - Dystopia (anime)|Destiny HERO - Dystopia]]!\" He activates the [[effect]] of \"Dystopia\", inflicting the [[ATK]] of the \"Decider\" used as material to Z-ARC, but as \"Dystopia\" blasts an energy sphere from its palms, Z-ARC explains that the [[Pendulum Effect]] of \"Supreme King Gate Zero\" prevents him from taking [[damage]] as long as he [[control]]s a \"[[Supreme King]]\" monster. The energy vanishes into \"Zero\", but Aster calls out to Yuya, asking if he can hear him. Z-ARC adds that the Pendulum Effect of \"Supreme King Gate Infinity\" also adds the damage he would have taken to his [[LP]], rising to 5600 LP. Aster asks if Yuya has lost his spirit completely, but Z-ARC doesn't reply, so Aster bites his lip and declares battle, [[attack]]ing a \"Darkwru\" with \"Dystopia\". But as \"Dystopia\" rises into the air with a sparking fist, Z-ARC activates the effect of \"Darkwurm\", negating the attack since he controls another \"Supreme King\" monster. \"Darkwurm\" turns immaterial and \"Dystopia\" phases through it, so Aster activates the Spell Card \"[[D-Soul Burst]]\", halving the ATK of \"Dystopia\" and inflicting it to both players. \"Dystopia\" falls to 1400 ATK and Z-ARC calls Aster a fool, reminding him that he can't be damaged as long as he controls \"Supreme King\" monsters, and \"Supreme King Gate Zero\" absorbs the blue energy, while Aster falls to 2600 LP. He urges Yuya to answer him even if he can only hear his voice faintly, but Z-ARC just uses the effect of \"Supreme King Gate Infinity\" to increase his LP by the damage he would have taken, rising to 7000 LP. Sora is shocked that Z-ARC has gained even more LP, and Aster asks if Yuya won't answer at all before activating the effect of \"Dystopia\" since its ATK or [[DEF]] changed, destroying a card Z-ARC controls with its \"[[Attack and effect names in Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V|Noble Justice]]\" effect. \"Dystopia\" sucks a \"Darkwurm\" into its palm, but Z-ARC doesn't react again and Aster asks if this won't work either, [[Set]]ting a card to end his turn.\n\n<!--Sora holds up Yuya's pendant.-->\nSora steps up, declaring that he'll face Z-ARC this time and make Yuya remember his Dueling with his own. He declares his turn and draws, knowing he can reach Yuya's heart. He activates the [[Continuous Spell Card]] \"[[Frightfur Sanctuary (anime)|Frightfur Sanctuary]]\" by sending a card from his hand and two \"[[Frightfur]]\" monsters from his [[Extra Deck]] to the [[Graveyard]]: \"[[Edge Imp Frightfuloid (anime)|Edge Imp Frightfuloid]]\", \"[[Frightfur Bear (later anime)|Frightfur Bear]]\" and \"[[Frightfur Tiger (anime)|Frightfur Tiger]]\". Explaining that the \"Edge Imp Frightfuloid\" is treated as a \"Frightfur\" monster while in his Graveyard, Sora activates the Spell Card \"[[Frightfur Fusion (anime)|Frightfur Fusion]]\", banishing the \"Frightfur Bear\", \"Frightfur Tiger\" and \"Edge Imp Frightfuloid\" in his Graveyard to Fusion Summon and chanting \"The inanimate toy that houses the devil, annihilate the fools who oppose me! Fusion Summon! Appear, the magical beast that's a combination of all toys! [[Frightfur Chimera (anime)|Frightfur Chimera]]!\" He urges Yuya to remember Dueling with him and declares battle, attacking the other \"Darkwurm\" with \"Chimera\", which launches a rocket from its maw to destroy \"Darkwurm\". Z-ARC reminds them that the effects of the \"Supreme King Gates\" \"Zero\" and \"Infinity\" will activate, \"Zero\" absorbing the smoke from the explosion and \"Infinity\" glowing as Z-ARC takes no damage, then gains LP equal to the damage he would have taken. He rises to 8000 LP, Aster gasping the value, and Sora smiles, commenting that he'll take the \"Darkwurm\" he destroyed, as the effect of \"Frightfur Chimera\" [[Special Summon]]s the monsters it destroys in battle and sends to the Graveyard to his side of the field. Z-ARC reminds Sora that \"Darkwurm\" was a Pendulum Monster, so it was sent to his Extra Deck and not his Graveyard, but Sora claims he remembered that, because it's happened before. He remembers his first Duel with Yuya, where \"[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon (anime)|Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]\" wasn't sent to the Graveyard after \"Frightfur Bear\" destroyed it, but to the Extra Deck, and holds up [[Yuya's pendant]] to Z-ARC. Aster is surprised to see it, realizing Sora must have picked it up after the darkness broke it from around Yuya's neck when he absorbed [[Yuri]], and Sora calls Yuya \"Teacher\" and begs him to remember what happened during their first Duel. But this time Z-ARC gives a single chuckle, and Sora sheds a single tear as Aster watches in shock, before Sora Sets a card to end his turn.\n\n<!--Sora and Aster destroy Z-ARC's cards.-->\nZ-ARC declares his turn and draws, then he Pendulum Summons his two \"Supreme King Dragon Darkwurms\" again. Aster activates a [[Trap Card]], \"[[D-Hyper Nova]]\", as he controls a \"[[Destiny HERO]]\" monster and Z-ARC Special Summoned a monster, destroying those Special Summoned monsters. Sora activates his own Trap, \"[[Frightfur Parade]]\" since he controls a \"Frightfur\" monster and an effect was activated that destroys monsters Z-ARC controls, destroying all cards Z-ARC controls and inflicting 500 damage to him for each. He comments that Z-ARC won't be able to counter this with his \"Gates\" and all four of Z-ARC's cards explode, Sora and Aster celebrating that they destroyed them all and exchanging nods. Aster declares there's still a chance and urges Sora not to give up, and Sora agrees that of course there it, then reassures Aster there's no need for formality and tells him to just call him Sora. Aster does so, declaring they'll keep this up and get their feelings through to the Yuya who is still inside. But Z-ARC smiles, commenting that fools can never recognizes their own mistakes and claiming they have signed their death warrants with one move and Aster asks \"What?\" while Sora asks what that's supposed to mean. \n\n<!--\"Astrograph Sorcerer\" restores Z-ARC's cards.-->\nDarkness surrounds Z-ARC as he explains that he can Special Summon this monster from his hand when cards he controls are destroyed, and he holds up the card, chanting \"Controller of time. controller of stars. All-powerful, all-knowing magician with power over spacetime, descend and give me your power! Come forth, [[Astrograph Sorcerer (anime)|Astrograph Sorcerer]]!\" \"Astrograph Sorcerer\" appears with 2500 ATK, and Aster and Sora recognizes the monster as the one that transformed Yuya into Z-ARC. Z-ARC then activates the effect of \"Astrograph Sorcerer\", restoring all the cards that were just destroyed. His two \"Darkwurms\" appear from its staff, and the two \"Supreme King Gates\" re-materialize in the Pendulum Zones. Sora grits his teeth, protesting that he thought that they got rid of them. Z-ARC begins laughing and his dark aura expands. Aster asks what is going to happen, and Sora grits his teeth again, cracking his lollipop. Z-ARC explains that by Tributing \"Astrograph Sorcerer\" and banishing the [[Four Dimension Dragons|four heavenly dragons]] from his Deck, Extra Deck, and Graveyard, he can activate its effect. He orders \"Astrograph Sorcerer\" to have the dragons become his fodder, and \"Astrograph Sorcerer\" glows blue and then dissipates as Z-ARC announces the four heavenly dragons; \"[[Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon (anime)|Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]\", \"[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon (anime)|Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]\", \"[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon (anime)|Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]\", and \"Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon\", and he orders them to become their foundation. As each Dragon is banished, the image of its owner appears beside it, and then angry red smoke begins belching from Z-ARC's body and crimson lightning begins to strike. Aster can only gasp \"W-What?\" and Sora asks what Z-ARC is going to do. But they get no answer as red lightning strikes the walls, and Aster notes that he doesn't really understand what's happening, but they'd better evacuate to somewhere safe. They two Academy students turn and run just in time as a fork of lightning hits the ground where they had been standing. \n\nBack at Duel Academy, [[Shay Obsidian|Shay]] and [[Kite Tenjo (ARC-V)|Kite]] see the red cloud has covered the entire island holding the city. Shay asks what on earth is going to happen, and Kite spots something and he tells Shay to look. They see Aster and Sora fleeing through a rip in space, and Kite wonders who they're Dueling. He sees Z-ARC's face, and he asks in shock if it's Yuya. He wonders if this is the Z-ARC that [[Yusho Sakaki|Yusho]] mentioned, and Shay asks in shock what Kite means. Kite muses that it must be; Z-ARC has revived. Shay looks back at Z-ARC, noting that this must be who Yuya, [[Yuto]], [[Yugo]] and Yuri reunited into; the devil Duelist. Kite suggests that they go; Aster and the others are in trouble.\n\n[[File:SupremeKingZARC-JP-Anime-AV-NC.png|thumb|right|250px|Z-ARC [[Unity Summon]]s his full form, \"[[Supreme King Z-ARC (anime)|Supreme King Z-ARC]]\" at last.]]\nAlone in the belching red smoke, Z-ARC chants \"Ultimate dragon, who reigns over the four heavenly dragons, in this moment, become one with me! [[Unity Summon]]! Come forth, [[Supreme King Z-ARC (anime)|Supreme King Z-ARC]]!\" (\"One merciless dragon, to rule over all others! Merge with me and we will dominate every dimension! Let us reunite, reunite as one! The ultimate union of man and monster! Pendulum, Xyz, Synchro, Fusion, all these powers are mine! With the mightiest power of each of the Four Dimensions combined into one! Together, we are Supreme King Z-ARC!\" in the dub; the chant is longer and encapsulates the following explanation). Z-ARC ascends into the smoke and then a titanic pair of wings erupts from the clouds as the Supreme King's red eyes gleam through the smoke. Then it beats its wings, dispelling the clouds and revealing Supreme King Z-ARC at last; a titanic grey and tan union of the Four Dimension Dragons with emerald highlights, its colossal tail and wings making up most of its size. It towers over the island with 4000 ATK as Z-ARC laughs and he declares that he is Pendulum, Xyz Synchro, and Fusion - the \"Z-ARC\" card is a hybrid of all four monster card types. He is the supreme being who rules them all.\n\n<!--Kite and Shay enter the Duel.-->\n<!--Aster and Sora are defeated.-->\nSora and Aster look at \"Z-ARC\" in shock from a nearby waterfront, Sora asking if a human united with a Duel Monster and Aster realizing that the enormous dragon was Z-ARC all along. Z-ARC suggests they finish this, but then a voice declares the activation of the [[Field Spell Card]] \"[[Crossover]]\", dispersing [[Action Card]]s and materializing [[Solid Vision]] platforms. Aster and Sora turn in surprise to see Shay and Kite running towards them, Duel Disks activated, and electricity crackles around both of them as they take the 2000 LP intrusion penalty, falling to 2000 LP each. Aster and Sora are pleased to see Kite and Shay, and Z-ARC applauds their courage in facing him, but this is as far as it goes. He tells them to behold his power - when he descends he destroys all monsters his opponent controls and Aster, Sora, Kite and Shay all react in shock as red lightning crackles around \"Z-ARC\" and then strikes, destroying \"Dystopia\" and \"Frightfur Chimera\". Z-ARC adds that his effect also inflicts damage equal to the destroyed monsters' total ATK to their controllers, much to Aster and Sora's horror, and Z-ARC reminds them that \"Dsytopia\" had 1400 ATK and \"Chimera\" had 2800, so the total they'll take is 4200. Aster and Sora can only wait in fear as the red lightning converges on them, blasting them and reducing their LP to zero, flinging Aster into the wall and Sora against the ground. \n\n<!--Kite and Shay face off against Z-ARC.-->\nKite and Shay run to Aster and Sora respectively, Kite asking if this is the Z-ARC that Yusho was talking about and asking what happened to Yuya. Aster weakly explains that Yuya has become Z-ARC, who has become \"Supreme King Z-ARC\", the union between that giant dragon and a human. Sora weakly asks the two Xyzians to take care of the rest, handing Yuya's pendant to Shay and asking him to bring Yuya back no matter what. Shay takes it, telling Sora to leave the rest to him, and he joins Kite in facing down Z-ARC, who asks if they're next. Shay steps forward, suggesting they do this and telling him that this form doesn't suit him. He tells Yuya to come back to them and declares his turn, drawing a card.\n\n==Featured Duel: Aster Phoenix and Sora Perse vs. Z-ARC==\n[[File:Zarc VS Aster & Sora.png|left|thumb|250px|[[Z-ARC]] VS [[Aster Phoenix (ARC-V)|Aster]] & [[Sora Perse|Sora]]]]\n'''<u>Turn 1: Z-ARC</u>'''<br />\n[[Z-ARC]] [[activate]]s \"[[Supreme King Gate Zero (anime)|Supreme King Gate Zero]]\" ({{Rightpendulum}} 0) and \"[[Supreme King Gate Infinity (anime)|Supreme King Gate Infinity]]\" ({{Leftpendulum}} 13) in his [[Pendulum Zone]]s. Z-ARC [[Pendulum Summon]]s two copies of the [[Level 4 Monster Cards|Level 4]] \"[[Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm (anime)|Supreme King Dragon Darkwurm]]\" (1800/1200), both from his [[hand]] in [[Attack Position]].\n\n'''<u>Turn 2: Aster</u>'''<br />\n[[Aster Phoenix (ARC-V)|Aster]] activates the [[Spell Card]] \"[[Polymerization (anime)|Polymerization]]\", [[Fusion Summon]]ing a [[Fusion Monster]] from his [[Extra Deck]] using [[monster]]s in his hand and [[field]] as [[Fusion Material]]s. He fuses \"[[Destiny HERO - Drilldark (anime)|Destiny HERO - Drilldark]]\" and \"[[Destiny HERO - Decider (anime)|Destiny HERO - Decider]]\" in his hand to Fusion Summon \"[[Destiny HERO - Dystopia (anime)|Destiny HERO - Dystopia]]\" (2800/2400) in Attack Position. As \"Dystopia\" was Fusion Summoned, Aster activates its effect, targeting one of the Fusion Materials used for its Summon and inflicting damage to Z-ARC equal its ATK. He targets the 1600 ATK \"Decider\", but as Z-ARC controls a \"[[Supreme King]]\" monster, the [[Pendulum Effect]] of \"Zero\" prevents him from taking damage. As Z-ARC took no damage due to the Pendulum Effect of \"Supreme King Gate Zero\", he activates the Pendulum effect of \"Infinity\", gaining LP equal to the original damage he would have taken (Z-ARC: 4000 → 5600 LP). \"Dystopia\" [[attack]]s a \"Darkwurm\", but as Z-ARC controls another \"Supreme King\" monster, he activates the effect of \"Darkwurm\", [[Negate|negating]] the attack. Aster activates the Spell Card \"[[D-Soul Burst]]\", targeting a \"[[Destiny HERO]]\" monster he controls and halving its AT, the each player takes damage equal to that lost ATK. He targets \"Dystopia\" (\"Dystopia\" 2800 → 1400/2400), but as Z-ARC would take damage while he controls a \"Supreme King\" monster, the Pendulum Effect of \"Zero\" prevents him from taking damage and he activates the Pendulum Effect of \"Infinity\", gaining LP equal to the damage he would have taken (Z-ARC: 5600 → 7000 LP, Aster: 4000 → 2600 LP). As the ATK or DEF of \"Dystopia\" was changed, Aster activates its effect, targeting a card on the field and [[destroy]]ing it. He destroys a \"Darkwurm\". Aster [[Set]]s a card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 3: Sora'''</u><br />\nSora activates the [[Continuous Spell Card]] \"[[Frightfur Sanctuary (anime)|Frightfur Sanctuary]]\" by [[send]]ing a card from his hand and two \"[[Frightfur]]\" monsters from his [[Extra Deck]] to the [[Graveyard]]. He sends \"[[Edge Imp Frightfuloid (anime)|Edge Imp Frightfuloid]]\" in his hand and \"[[Frightfur Bear (later anime)|Frightfur Bear]]\" and \"[[Frightfur Tiger (anime)|Frightfur Tiger]]\" in his Extra Deck to the Graveyard. The effect of \"Frightfur Sanctuary\" allows Sora to treat all Fusion Monsters he controls as \"Frightfur\" monsters. Sora activates the Spell Card \"[[Frightfur Fusion (anime)|Frightfur Fusion]]\", Fusion Summoning a \"[[Frightfur]]\" Fusion Monster from his Extra Deck by banishing its Fusion Materials from his side of the field or his Graveyard. He banishes \"Frightfuloid\", treated as a \"Frightfur\" monster by its own effect, \"Bear\", and \"Tiger\" from his Graveyard to Fusion Summon \"[[Frightfur Chimera (anime)|Frightfur Chimera]]\" (2800/2000) in Attack Position. \"Chimera\" attacks and destroys \"Darkwurm\", and the Pendulum Effects of \"Zero\" and \"Infinity\" prevent Z-ARC from taking damage and Z-ARC gains LP equal to the damage he would have taken (Z-ARC: 7000 → 8000 LP). Sora Sets a card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 4: Z-ARC'''</u><br />\nZ-ARC Pendulum Summons the two copies of the Level 4 \"Darkwurm\" (1800/1200) from his Extra Deck in Attack Position. As a monster was Special Summoned to Aster's opponent's field while they control a Special Summoned monster and Aster controls a \"Destiny HERO\" monster, Aster activates his Set [[Trap Card]] \"[[D-Hyper Nova]]\", destroying all monsters that were Special Summoned to his opponent's field this turn. As a card or effect that would destroy a card Sora's opponent controls was activated while Sora controls a face-up \"[[Frightfur]]\" monster, Sora activates his Set Trap Card \"[[Frightfur Parade]]\", destroying all cards Z-ARC controls and inflicting 500 damage to him for each. \"Zero\", \"Infinity\", and the two \"Darkwurms\" are destroyed (Z-ARC: 8000 → 6000). As a card Z-ARC controls was destroyed, Z-ARC activates the effect of \"[[Astrograph Sorcerer (anime)|Astrograph Sorcerer]]\" in his hand, targeting the destroyed cards and [[Special Summon]]ing it, then placing all cards targeted by this effect in the zones they were in when they were destroyed. He Special Summons \"Astrograph Sorcerer\" (2500/2000) in Attack Position and places \"Zero\" ({{Rightpendulum}} 0) and \"Infinity\" ({{Leftpendulum}} 13) in his Pendulum Zones and the two copies of \"Darkwurm\" in his [[Monster Zone]]s. Z-ARC activates the second effect of \"Astrograph Sorcerer\", [[Tribute|Tributing]] it to [[banish]] \"[[Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon (anime)|Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon]]\", \"[[Clear Wing Synchro Dragon (anime)|Clear Wing Synchro Dragon]]\", \"[[Starving Venom Fusion Dragon (anime)|Starving Venom Fusion Dragon]]\", and \"[[Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon (anime)|Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon]]\" from his [[Main Deck|Deck]], Extra Deck, field, and Graveyard to Special Summon \"[[Supreme King Z-ARC (anime)|Supreme King Z-ARC]]\" from his Extra Deck. He banishes \"Dark Rebellion\", \"Clear Wing\", and \"Starving Venom\" from his Extra Deck and \"Odd-Eyes\" from his Deck to [[Unity Summon]] \"Supreme King Z-ARC\" from his Extra Deck (4000/4000) in Attack Position.\n\nAt this point, [[Shay Obsidian]] and [[Kite Tenjo (ARC-V)|Kite Tenjo]] join the Duel, taking the intrusion penalty (Shay: 4000 → 2000 LP; Kite: 4000 → 2000 LP). With Shay joining the Duel, the [[Field Spell Card]] \"[[Crossover]]\" is [[activate]]d, as per the rules of an [[Action Duel]]. It will allow the players to use [[Action Card]]s, but they may only have one in their [[hand]] at a time.\n\nAs \"Z-ARC\" was Special Summoned, Z-ARC activates its effect, destroying all monsters his opponents control and inflicting damage to all players whose monsters were destroyed equal to the total ATK of the destroyed monsters, but \"Z-ARC\" cannot attack the turn this effect was activated. Aster's 1400 ATK \"Dystopia\" and Sora's 2800 ATK \"Chimera\" are destroyed, so they both take 4200 damage (Aster: 2600 → 0 LP, Sora 4000 → 0 LP).\n\n{{duelnext|Featured Duel: Shay Obsidian and Kite Tenjo vs. Z-ARC}}\n\n==Featured cards==\nThe following cards appeared in this episode.
