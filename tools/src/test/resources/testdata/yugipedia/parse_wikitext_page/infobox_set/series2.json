Official Card Game]]'' (''OCG''). It is the first Core Booster in the ''OCG'' [[Series 2]].\n\nIts name comes from the high volume of [[Spell Card]]s, which are known as Magic Cards in the Japanese version and were previously known as Magic Cards in other languages.\n\nIn the ''[[TCG]]'' and Korean ''OCG'', this set was combined with ''[[Pharaoh's Servant (Japanese)|Pharaoh's Servant]]'' and released as ''[[Magic Ruler]]'' (although it was later renamed ''Spell Ruler'').\n\nThis set has been reprinted in the ''[[Duelist Legacy Volume.1]]'', which features the same [[cover card]]s \"[[Relinquished]]\" and \"[[Spellbinding Circle]]\".\n\n==Features==\n* Includes cards used by [[Dark Yugi (manga)|Dark Yugi]], [[Bandit Keith (manga)|Bandit Keith]] and [[Maximillion J. Pegasus (manga)|Maximillion J. Pegasus]]\n* Includes members and/or support for the \"[[Archfiend]]\" and \"[[Gravekeeper]]\" archetypes.\n* This booster comes with cards which were video game-only at that time, including \"[[High Tide Gyojin]]\", \"[[Whiptail Crow]]\", \"[[Dark Witch]]\", \"[[Axe of Despair]]\", \"[[Malevolent Nuzzler]]\" and \"[[Guardian of the Throne Room]]\".\n* This is the first set to contain a [[Ritual Monster]] after ''[[Dark Ceremony Edition]]''. ''Magic Ruler'' introduces [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s to the ''OCG''.\n* ''Magic Ruler'' contains highly sought after Spell Cards, including \"[[Snatch Steal]]\", \"[[The Forceful Sentry]]\", \"[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]\" and \"[[Giant Trunade]]\".\n\n==Breakdown==\n\nEach pack contained 5 cards and each box contained 30 packs.\n\nThe set contained 50 cards, or 53 in the [[Master Set]]. This comprised of:\n* 3 [[Ultra Parallel Rare]]\n* 3 [[Ultra Rare]]\n* 4 [[Super Rare]]\n* 4 [[Rare]]\n* 39 [[Common]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery heights=\"175px\" captionalign=\"center\">\nMR-BoosterJP.jpg | [[Set Card Galleries:Magic Ruler (OCG-JP)|Japanese]]\nMR-JP.png | Logo\n</gallery>\n\n==List==\n{{Set navigation\n| lists        = JP\n| ue_galleries = JP\n}}\n\n{{Set list transclusion}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.yugioh-card.com/hk/lineup/cn-t/duel_monsters/magic/ yugioh-card.com] {{icon|Chinese}}\n\n{{Core Boosters}}\n{{Series 2 sets}}\n\n[[Category:OCG Core Boosters]]"}}
