It has been released in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game]]'' (''TCG'') in English, French, German, Italian and Spanish and in the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game]]'' (''OCG'') in [[Asian-English]] and [[Korean]]. There are three separate prints with different language IDs for the ''TCG'' English sets, North American, European and Worldwide.\n\nThe North American and Worldwide versions of this set contained 104 cards. Europe initially received the North American English set, i.e. the set with cards numbered MRL-XXX. A European English version was later released containing 27 more cards, which had been excluded from the European versions of ''[[Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon]]'', ''[[Starter Deck: Yugi]]'', and ''[[Starter Deck: Kaiba]]''.\n\nIn the ''TCG'', this set became legal for Constructed tournaments on October 1, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=Duelist King Tournament |url=http://www.upperdeckentertainment.com/tournament/rules.asp |website=Upper Deck Entertainment Tournament |publisher=Upper Deck Entertainment |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021201083519/http://www.upperdeckentertainment.com/tournament/rules.asp |archive-date=1 December 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe rename from ''Magic Ruler'' to ''Spell Ruler'' was to go with the renaming of Magic Cards to [[Spell Card]]s. The European and Worldwide English versions of the set used the name ''Spell Ruler''. The European version used the set ID ''MRL'', despite the boosters continuing to be labeled ''Spell Ruler'', while the Worldwide version used the ID ''SRL''. \n\nThe cards numbered ''SRL-EN'' were included in ''[[Master Collection Volume 1]]''.\n\nIn 2010, an [[Unlimited Edition]] North American version of the set was reprinted, with SRL [[Set Number]]s, and released as part of the [[Legendary Collection]].\n\n==Features==\nThis set introduced [[Ritual Spell Card]]s, [[Ritual Monster]]s, [[Quick-Play Spell Card]]s and [[Toon monsters]] to the ''TCG''.\n\nHighly sought-after cards in this set include \"[[Delinquent Duo]]\", \"[[Snatch Steal]]\", \"[[Mystical Space Typhoon]]\", \"[[Cyber Jar]]\", and \"[[Painful Choice]]\".\n\n==Breakdown==\nThe Asian-English and ''TCG'' versions of this set contained 9 cards per pack and 24 packs per box. The Korean version contained 10 cards per pack.\n\nThe Worldwide English, North American English, Spanish, Korean and Asian-English versions of this set contained 104 cards, including:\n* 2 [[Secret Rare]]\n* 10 [[Ultra Rare]]\n* 10 [[Super Rare]]\n* 17 [[Rare]]\n* 65 [[Common]]\n\nThe European English, French, German and Italian versions of this set contained 131 cards, including:\n* 2 [[Secret Rare]]\n* 10 [[Ultra Rare]]\n* 10 [[Super Rare]]\n* 18 [[Rare]]\n* 91 [[Common]]\n\nThe additional 27 cards had previously been omitted from other European releases:\n* 103 to 106: ''[[Starter Deck: Yugi]]''\n* 107 to 110: ''[[Starter Deck: Kaiba]]''\n* [[Comparison of North American and European Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon|111 to 129]]: ''[[Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon]]''\n\n==Galleries==\n{{Main|Miscellaneous Gallery:Spell Ruler}}\n\n<gallery heights=\"175px\" captionalign=\"center\">\nSRL-BoosterEN.png | Worldwide English<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-EN-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\nMRL-BoosterNA.png | North American English<br />(Magic Ruler)<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Magic Ruler (TCG-NA-1E)|1st Edition]] / [[Set Card Galleries:Magic Ruler (TCG-NA-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\nSRL-BoosterNA.png | North American English<br />(Spell Ruler)<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-NA-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\nMRL-BoosterEU.jpg | European English<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-EU-1E)|1st Edition]] / [[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-EU-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\n\nMDM-BoosterFR.jpg | French<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-FR-1E)|1st Edition]] / [[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-FR-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\nSRL-BoosterDE.jpg | German<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-DE-1E)|1st Edition]] / [[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-DE-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\nSDM-BoosterIT.jpg | Italian<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-IT-1E)|1st Edition]] / [[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-IT-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\nSDH-BoosterSP.png | Spanish<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (TCG-SP-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\n\nMRL-BoosterAE.jpg | Asian-English<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (OCG-AE-1E)|1st Edition]]\nSRL-BoosterKR.jpg | Korean<br />[[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (OCG-KR-1E)|1st Edition]] / [[Set Card Galleries:Spell Ruler (OCG-KR-UE)|Unlimited Edition]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Lists==\n{{Set navigation\n| lists        = EN,NA,EU,FR,DE,IT,SP,AE,KR\n| 1e_galleries = NA,EU,FR,DE,IT,SP,AE,KR\n| ue_galleries = EN,NA,EU,FR,DE,IT,SP,KR\n}}\n\n{{Set list tabs|EN,NA,EU,FR,DE,IT,SP,AE,KR}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Core Boosters}}\n\n[[Category:International Core Boosters]]"}}
