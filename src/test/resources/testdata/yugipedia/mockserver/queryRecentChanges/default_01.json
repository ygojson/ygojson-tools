(anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime.\n\n==Design==\n===Appearance===\n[[File:Mai Linework.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Mai's design incorporates multiple layers of clothing and a wide range of expressions. Depicted here is the Duelist in full regalia from the front and side views and alongside views of her head from different angles.]]\n\nMai's character design was overseen by [[Kazuki Takahashi]]. Mai is fair-skinned with purple eyes, and long, thick, spiky blonde hair. In the anime, in [[Duelist Kingdom]], Mai wore a short-sleeved purple coat over her white tube top, which shows her belly button, along with recurring purple high-heeled boots. From [[Battle City]] on, she changed to a sleeveless light purple vest and a white tank top and wore long white fingerless gloves. She wears a dark purple mini-skirt and a Deck holder strapped to her thigh in the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City arcs and her cameo appearances at KC Grand Championship arc, but in [[Waking the Dragons]], she wears dark purple shorts and now wears purple gloves. In ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]'', she is seen in an outfit similar to the one she wore in Waking the Dragons. However, her top is white/grey instead of purple.\n\nIn the manga, in [[Duelist Kingdom]], she largely wore the same outfit as the anime, but her top was open, revealing the middle of her chest, and held together using strings, like a corset. In Battle City, she changed to wearing a black leather vest and miniskirt, and wore a similar tube top as her Duelist Kingdom self, but with the front closed.\n\nIn the dub, from Season 2 onwards, her cleavage and lines of cleavage are digitally reduced, and her miniskirt is lengthened.\n\n===Personality===\nAt the beginning of the series, Mai is a self-absorbed woman who is only set out for prize money, personal satisfaction and power. She was also very arrogant and prideful of her Dueling skills and looks.\n\nAt first, Mai often used her beauty to seduce men into giving her what she wants and making them her tools. She used her beauty to easily steal [[Rex Raptor]]'s luxury room on the cruise to Duelist Kingdom by offering him a kiss if he could beat her in a Duel, and later manipulated him into Dueling Joey for her as petty revenge on Joey for defeating her in an earlier Duel.\n\nMai is extremely lonely and at first, is convinced that she doesn't need friends. At one point, she believed her \"[[Harpie|Harpie Lady]]\" cards were the closest she would ever have to friends.\n\nMai's selfish attitude and outlook on life continues until she meets and finds meaning with [[Yugi Muto]] and his three best friends. After she meets them and Yugi fought Panik for her to regain her Star Chips, Mai begins seeing [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]], [[Joey Wheeler]], [[Tristan Taylor]], and [[Téa Gardner|Téa]] as her friends. She even offered Yugi her extra Star Chips so he could enter the Duelist Kingdom's Finals and rescue his grandfather after Yugi lost to [[Seto Kaiba|Kaiba]], and gave [[Joey Wheeler|Joey]] her entry fee card for the finals when his was stolen by [[Bandit Keith]]. From there, she continued meeting up with the four on occassions and helping them out from time to time on their adventures.\n\nMai's feelings of loneliness and emptiness return when she is forced to face [[Marik Ishtar]] in the Battle City finals. [[Marik Ishtar|Marik]] enters her into a Shadow Game, where with each of her monsters destroyed she begins losing the memory of a former friend. In the end, Marik defeats her and leaves her mind trapped in the Shadow Realm for a long time while she continues feeling more and more alone, miserable, and isolated every minute, until Yugi finally defeats Marik in the final round and releases her.\n\nAfter being freed from the Shadow Realm and gone separate ways from her friends for a while, Mai's wins become empty to her and her feelings of loneliness return even more. Eventually, she is unable to cope with the mental trauma and turns against her friends, joining the evil [[Dartz]] to assist him in his quest for power. However, Joey seems to eventually return her to her old self and she recovers her self-esteem and pride as a true Duelist, but was unable to face her former friends again after what she had done to them.\n\nIn the Japanese version; Mai typically uses a quite informal manner of speech. She commonly omits honorifics when speaking with others, but addresses [[Anzu]] and [[Shizuka]] as \"-chan.\" She uses the informal and potentially condescending \"anta\", a contraction of the more formal \"anata\" (similar to the English \"honey\"). She uses the personal pronoun \"atakushi\", which tends to be a more elegant, if not older, form of self-reference.\n\n===Etymology===\n\"Kujaku Mai\" means \"peacock dance\" in Japanese. Her name in the dub is a pun of \"My Valentine\".\n\n==Biography==\n===Prior to debut===\n[[File:Young Mai.png|thumb|left|150px|Mai as a child.]]\nMai was orphaned at a young age and spent much of her time alone (in the dub, she instead recounts that her parents were always busy and were away from home to work).<ref name=\"ep 91\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|91|ref}}</ref>\n\nMai once worked as a card dealer on a ship-board casino, where she first discovered the \"[[Harpie|Harpie Lady]]\" cards. A lot of men, who she described as boring, would pay money to get with her. Using her \"aroma tactics\", she pretended she had psychic powers, as she could tell what her cards were without looking at them, since they were sprayed with different perfumes. With these tactics she defeated such men, winning their money. Although she made a lot of money, she got bored and quit.\n\nShe met [[Jean-Claude Magnum]] while working there. The two Dueled, ending in the actor's defeat. Magnum proposed to her, to which she refused and told him to come back when he became a good Duelist.<ref name=\"ep 80\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|80|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Duelist Kingdom===\nMai was invited to participate in the [[Duelist Kingdom]] tournament.\n\nOn the boat to the tournament, she meets [[Yugi Muto]] and [[Joey Wheeler]] and challenges [[Rex Raptor]] to a Duel. She wins using her aroma tactics, and evicts Rex from his luxury room.\n\nAt the Duelist Kingdom island, Mai watches Yugi's Duel with [[Weevil Underwood]] and comments on how Yugi doesn't stand a chance - criticism that was clearly in contrast with Yugi's friends' encouragement. She later Duels [[Joey Wheeler]], psyching him out with her aroma tactics while powering up her \"[[Harpie Lady (anime)|Harpie Lady]]\". Joey wins after exposing her \"psychic powers\" as a fraud.\n\nShe wins a few off-screen Duels, and is later challenged to a rematch by [[Rex Raptor]]. She didn't want to face Rex since she had already defeated him, but still wanted to beat Joey. She thought it would be immature to challenge Joey again, so she offered to Duel Rex, provided he defeated Joey first. If she could beat Rex after he beat Joey, that would be like beating both of them, she thought.\n\nShe caught up with Joey and his friends and got Joey to face Rex. She got mad when Rex made a bet to try to win Joey's \"[[Time Wizard (anime)|Time Wizard]]\", as he would be able to use it against her later. However, Joey managed to win.\n\nShe shared her food with Yugi, Joey and their friends, saying they could be friends tonight, but enemies tomorrow.\n\nThat night, she was targeted by Pegasus' eliminator, [[PaniK]]. Yugi and his friends heard her scream and rushed to help her, finding that she had lost all her Star Chips to PaniK. Yugi defeated PaniK and returned Mai's [[Star Chips]].\n\nAfter Yugi loses to [[Seto Kaiba|Kaiba]], Mai offers him some of her extra Star Chips claiming she owed him them. Yugi cannot accept them, so Téa Duels Mai for the Star Chips. Mai begins to greatly outplay Téa. But after Téa makes a comeback, Mai, impressed by Téa's spirit and eager to repay her debt to Yugi, surrenders so Yugi can take the Star Chips.\n\n[[File:Maivalentineandharpies.jpg|thumb|left|Mai and her Harpies]]\nIn the finals, she is paired against Yugi in the first match. [[Yami Yugi]] was distracted by the prospect of Dueling Pegasus to win back the souls of Yugi's grandfather and the Kaiba brothers, and was not taking Mai seriously as an opponent, forcing Yugi and Mai to help convince him to face Mai out of principle. In the dub, Yugi was afraid of what happened in his Duel with Kaiba and wouldn't let Yami Duel. Mai initially dominates Yugi, but helps him face his own fears, allowing Yami to make a comeback that leaves Mai at a complete disadvantage. With her strongest monster destroyed, Mai chooses to surrender rather than see the rest of her \"[[Harpie]]\" monsters destroyed as well. With Bandit Keith's disqualification from the tournament, Mai's final placing in the Duelist Kingdom Tournament is 3rd.\n\nAfter her loss, she gives Joey one of her [[Glory of the King's Hand|entry cards]], to prevent him being disqualified.\n\n===Legendary Heroes===\n[[File:Legendary Heroes Mai.png|thumb|right|Mai's 2nd outfit for the Legendary Heroes game.]]\n\nShortly after [[Duelist Kingdom]], Mai Valentine was invited by [[The Big 5]] to test out the new, reprogrammed version of the Virtual Game that Seto Kaiba has built. [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]], [[Joey Wheeler|Joey]] and [[Mokuba Kaiba|Mokuba]] searched for Kaiba. On the way, Joey was forced to Duel Mai. When she finds out her opponent is Joey (as they were both masked), she joins in the search for Kaiba. On the way, they were attacked by a \"Sand Stone\" monster, trapped in a Maze, fought an army of [[Winged Beast|Winged Beasts]] and [[Insect|Insect monsters]] and fought the Big Five's \"[[Mythic Dragon (anime)|Mythic Dragon]]\". Each of the five [[Legendary Heroes]] had to Summon a Dragon-type monster in order to defeat the Big 5. Mai Summoned her \"[[Harpie's Pet Dragon (anime)|Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\". Mai sacrificed her Dragon so that Yugi's \"[[Black Luster Soldier (anime)|Black Luster Soldier]]\" could stay on the field, therefore losing all her [[Life Points]]. She was later revived by the \"[[Mystical Elf (anime)|Mystical Elf]]\".\n\n===Battle City===\n[[File:Npc-kujaku-mai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mai's appearance during [[Battle City]].]]\n\nDuring [[Battle City]], Mai wins enough Duels off-screen to qualify to the quarter finals. She assists Yugi and Joey's friends (Serenity, Tristan, and Duke) by driving them in [[Mai's car|her car]] to Yugi and Joey's Duel at the [[Domino Pier|pier]]. She explains how she knows about the [[Rare Hunters]] as a group who lie, cheat, and steal rare cards. She also wonders what is going on in the piers.\n\nBefore proceeding to the quarter finals she meets [[Jean-Claude Magnum]]. She does not recognize him at first, but comes to remember him proposing and her telling him to come back when he became a better Duelist. Magnum holds her to that and Duels her again. This time if he wins, she marries him. Mai wins and Magnum tries to kidnap her in desperation using a hang glider. Mai nearly falls to her death but is saved by Joey.<ref name=\"ep 80\" />\n\nAfter Joey becomes unconscious in his Duel with [[Odion]], he has a dream involving his friends which helps him regain consciousness. When Mai asks if she was in his dream, Joey lies and says that she wasn't. This infuriates Mai and she proceeds to Duel [[Marik Ishtar]] in the next round, ignoring any help or support her friends try to give. Mai takes a clear advantage in the Duel, outplaying Marik and even stealing his Egyptian God Card, \"[[The Winged Dragon of Ra (anime)|The Winged Dragon of Ra]]\" with \"[[Amazoness Chain Master (anime)|Amazoness Chain Master]]\". However, Marik uses the powers of his [[Millennium Rod]] to take the Duel to the [[Shadow Realm]] (or make the Duel a Yami no Game in Japan), where whenever one of Mai's Monsters is destroyed, she loses the memory of one of her friends. Toward the end of the Duel, Mai has 3 copies of \"[[Cyber Harpie (anime)|Cyber Harpie]]\" and is in a position to win, however she tries to Summon \"Ra\", only to have it appear in Sphere mode, as she isn't one of the chosen ones with the power to control it. Since she couldn't read the Hieratic text to unlock Ra, Marik does so, using its ability to swap the card back over to his side. Her feelings of loneliness and emptiness return, despite encouragement from Yugi. Just as she is about to lose, Joey rushes onto the field, trying to stop the Duel. After Joey talks to Mai, he eventually manages to break through to her and her memory of Joey is restored, much to the shock and upset of Marik, who comments in the Japanese version that he is surprised their bond of genuine and strong friendship is actually strong enough to break though his powers. She then loses to Marik. In the dub, she is sent to the Shadow Realm after she loses to Marik, while in the Japanese version, she is trapped within her own mind, subjected to brutal mental assaults. After Marik's defeat, Yugi saves her. She parts ways with Joey and the others after the tournament, realizing that they indeed were her true and closest friends, she must ultimately move on.\n\n===Waking the Dragons===\n[[File:Mai-ep153-15s.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Mai in [[Waking the Dragons]].]]\nMai continues her Duel Monsters career by herself and wins several minor tournaments, but is overshadowed by [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]], [[Seto Kaiba|Kaiba]], and [[Joey Wheeler|Joey]], and without her friends to show her the way again, her fear of defeat still persists. She also suffers recurring nightmares of [[Yami Marik]]. (In the dub, Mai dreams of [[Yami Marik]] trapping her permanently in the Shadow Realm, while in the Japanese version she dreams that she's trapped again and [[Marik]] is trying to kill her while she helplessly calls on her friends to save her but to no avail.)<ref name=\"ep 152\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|152|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter winning one particular tournament, she shatters the trophy after hearing the runner-up and his friends say how embarrassing it is to lose to someone like her, that she isn't a strong Duelist like Yugi, Seto and Joey are, and believe those three, unlike her, are still eons above them in strength. \n\nAfterwards, she meets [[Valon]], who recognizes her as a fellow Duelist who wants nothing more than to always win (while in the dub he sees her as a loner). He wants her to stand by his side and he'll keep on winning, just for her, against anyone she wants. He says that she is \"his\" reason to keep on winning (while in the dub he encourages her to forget about her friends and gain the power of \"[[The Seal of Orichalcos (anime)|The Seal of Orichalcos]]\" by joining [[Dartz]]'s henchmen).<ref name=\"ep 152\" />\n\nOn Dartz's orders, Mai ambushes and defeats [[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]], trapping his soul.<ref name=\"ep 151\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|151|ref}}</ref> Under Dartz's influence, Mai believes that it was Yugi, Joey, and her other friends that abandoned her.<ref name=\"ep 153\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|153|ref}}</ref> She particularly despises Joey and wants to defeat him for herself. Valon, who has developed feelings for Mai, believes Joey to be the source of Mai's suffering and aims to take out Joey himself, although Mai doesn't agree to this.\n\nMai saves Joey and his friends from a gang of bikers by throwing cards at them. Although the gang does not get a clear view of their rescuer, Joey gets a glimpse of one of her \"Harpie Lady\" cards as well as a glimpse of her in her helmet visor and begins to suspect that it is her.<ref name=\"ep 151\" />\n\nYugi, Joey and their friends arrive at the [[Industrial Illusions]] headquarters to meet Pegasus but instead find Mai and are locked in. Mai faces Joey in a Duel, using \"The Seal of Orichalcos\", putting both players' souls at stake.<ref name=\"ep 151\" /> Although Mai dominates most of the Duel, Joey makes a comeback after acquiring his [[Legendary Dragons|Legendary Dragon]]. When it becomes apparent that Joey is about to win (when he actually is trying to end it in a draw to save them both), Valon intervenes, using his fragment of the Orichalcos to break the seal, saving Mai.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|154|ref}}</ref> This greatly angers Mai as she claims to have had the Duel under control.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|155|ref}}</ref>\n\nValon takes matters into his own hands and tries to defeat Joey before Mai can face him again. Joey manages to win and change Valon's attitude. Mai catches the end of the Duel and Valon tries telling her that Joey is a good guy. Regardless, Mai gets possessed by the powers of the Orichalchos again and faces Joey again. Joey accepts, realizing that he can never truly get through to her until she is freed from Dartz's control. Joey tries to convince Mai that Dartz has deceived her. Too exhausted from both Duels to play well, Joey nearly passes out as Mai is about to win. Mai finally sees through all of the deception and remembers everything that they went through, and as a result, doesn't declare her final attack and rushes over to catch Joey. The Seal, however, proceeds to take Joey's spirit because he no longer has the strength to continue, and therefore, loses the Duel. Devastated, she holds Joey close in her arms and tearfully tells him she won't let the Orichalchos take him away, as the Seal closes in. Before losing his soul, Joey pushes Mai away and throws her fragment of the Orichalchos in the air. She screams in agony as Joey loses his soul while breaking the fragment, her strong emotions finally freeing her from Dartz's influence. Afterwards, Mai sadly admitted she didn't want to win this way & questioned what did she gain from robbing her friend's soul?\n\nIn an attempt to pay back Joey and Valon, she tries to take on Dartz to beat him and win back their souls, but is instead confronted and defeated by [[Rafael]] at their headquarters, resulting in the loss of her own soul.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|174|ref}}</ref> Rafael later saves her life by pulling her unconscious body from the wreckage of the collapsing headquarters.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|177|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter Yugi, Kaiba and Joey defeat Dartz, Mai's soul is freed alongside Valon's, as well as all others who were victim to the Orichalchos.\n\n===Pyramid of Light===\n[[File:Mai Valentine Pyramid of Light.png|thumb|right|200px|Mai's appearance during ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Pyramid of Light]]'']]\n\nIn the ''Yu-Gi-Oh! The Pyramid of Light'' movie, Mai was seen drinking juice in a nearby café near a big-screen news airing about the Battle City finals, sporting a displeased expression.\n\n===Life reevaluation===\nMai spends the rest of the series alone and out of the picture, reevaluating her life, and trying to rediscover her passion for Dueling. In the dub, Mai claims she cannot ever see Joey and the others until she can \"face up\" to what she's done. Mai leaves one of her \"Harpie Lady\" cards with Valon (in this case, \"[[Cyber Harpie (anime)|Cyber Harpie]]\"); she also promises to return one day to both Joey and Valon as a worthy duelist. However, in the dub, Mai and Valon's relationship seems to end, and she doesn't say whether she will go back to Joey.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|184|ref}}</ref>\n\nShe is on the invitation list to participate in the [[KC Grand Prix]] but only attends the final Duel as a spectator to witness [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]] defeat [[Leon von Schroeder]].<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|185|ref}}</ref><ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|198|ref}}</ref> Though not a part of the action of the final season, she is seen in passing a few times, such as being shown as one of the Duelists destined to be a part of the Pharaoh's journey according to Pegasus (when Mai is shown, she is sitting alone in [[Mai's car|her car]] looking up to the clear skies).<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|220|ref}}</ref> The ending credits in the Japanese version shows her Dueling alongside [[Vivian Wong]] against the Meikyū Brothers ([[Paradox Brothers]]) on top of the Great Wall of China.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|224|ref}}</ref> However in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]'', there is no record of this Duel, as it was said that the Paradox Brothers' had only ever lost once, which was in their last Duel, before facing [[Jaden Yuki|Jaden]] and [[Syrus Truesdale|Syrus]].<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|10|ref}}</ref> This referred to their Duel with [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]] and [[Joey Wheeler|Joey]], so it is unclear whether the brothers were lying as per usual, or whether they defeated or tied Mai and Vivian.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!|21|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Yu-Gi-Oh! GX===\nShe is mentioned only once in ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! GX]]''. When [[Lyman Banner|Professor Banner]] teaches the students about Dueling legends like [[Yugi Muto]] and [[Seto Kaiba]], a [[Slifer Red]] shouts from the crowd, \"I like Mai Valentine!\" However, that line is not present in the Japanese version.<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! GX|40|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's===\nIn ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's]]'', a parody of her named Maizuru Kujyaku is listed as one the Duelists defeated by [[Hunter Pace]].<ref>{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's|1|ref}}</ref>\n\n==Relationships==\n===Joey Wheeler===\nShe is often paired up with her dearest and closest friend, [[Joey Wheeler]]. There is no clear cut indicator that they are deeply romantically interested in one another throughout the manga or anime, though it has been implied in the anime (more so in the Dub). Before their duel, [[Valon]] remarks to himself that Mai still loves Joey despite her obsessive desire to defeat him. Mai is viewed as a role model by [[Serenity Wheeler]].\n\n==Decks==\n===Duelist Kingdom===\nDuring [[Duelist Kingdom]], Mai used a '''\"[[Harpie]]\" Deck''' focused on summoning her key card, \"[[Harpie Lady (anime)|Harpie Lady]]\" and boosting its capabilities through various [[Equip Spell Card]]s such as \"[[Rose Whip]]\" and \"[[Cyber Shield (anime)|Cyber Shield]]\". Furthermore, she also used a [[swarm]] strategy to duplicate her powered up \"Harpie Lady\". For tougher opponents, Mai also had a hidden ace, \"[[Harpie's Pet Dragon (anime)|Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\".\n\n{{Decklist|\n|normal monsters =\n* [[Dark Witch (anime)|Dark Witch]]\n* [[Harpie Lady (anime)|Harpie Lady]] x3\n|effect monsters =\n* [[Harpie Lady Sisters (anime)|Harpie Lady Sisters]]\n* [[Harpie's Pet Dragon (anime)|Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\n|magic =\n* [[Cyber Shield (anime)|Cyber Shield]] x2\n* [[De-Spell (anime)|De-Spell]]\n* [[Elegant Egotist (anime)|Elegant Egotist]]\n* [[Harpie's Feather Duster (anime)|Harpie's Feather Duster]] x2\n* [[Monster Reborn (anime)|Monster Reborn]]\n* [[Rose Whip]]\n* [[Shadow of Eyes (anime)|Shadow of Eyes]]<ref group=Notes name=trapasspell>This card was played as a [[Spell Card|Magic Card]].

The Movie: Pyramid of Light''}}\n\n'''''Yu-Gi-Oh! the Movie: The Pyramid of Light''''', known in Japan as '''''Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters: Pyramid of Light''''', is an anime film based on the ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! (anime)|Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' anime. The film's director was [[Hatsuki Tsuji]].\n\nIn English, the character names and voice actors are the same as the English dub of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime.\n\nThe movie was also adapted as an ani-manga, ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie Ani-Manga]]'', and a Japanese novel, ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters: Pyramid of Light (novel)|Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters: Pyramid of Light]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:MOV-Pyramid-of-Light-and-Tablet-Montage.jpg|thumb|right|425px|The [[Pyramid of Light]] (right) and its Stone Tablet on display at the Domino City museum. Note the three [[Egyptian God]]s ([[Slifer]], [[Ra]], and [[Obelisk]]) engraved on the Tablet.]]\nThe events of [[Battle City]] have just concluded, and [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]] now owns all three [[Egyptian God]] cards. [[Seto Kaiba]] longs to finally defeat him, and he has a plan. He suspects that since [[Maximillion Pegasus]] created the Egyptian God cards, he would have also created a way to beat them, just in case something ever went wrong.\n\nKaiba heads off to Pegasus's castle and challenges him to a [[Duel]]. The stakes are the following: if Pegasus wins, he gets Kaiba's three \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragons]]\"; if Kaiba wins, Pegasus hands over the card that can beat the Egyptian Gods. Kaiba wins, and Pegasus must fulfill his wager: he picks up two cards from Pegasus's [[deck]]s. However, Pegasus is confused; he only created ''one'' card to beat the Egyptian Gods, not two...\n\nMeanwhile, Yugi Muto and [[Téa Gardner]], seeking refuge from a mob of duelists wanting to face Yugi for the Egyptian Gods, stumble into Domino Museum, where they discover a new attraction on display called the [[Pyramid of Light]], which looks a little like the Millennium Puzzle. Yugi's grandpa, [[Solomon Muto]] (who also happens to be visiting the museum), reads an inscription on the side of a sarcophagus (''The eye that sees what's yet to come, its vision shall be fulfilled, unless blinded by events predetermined, thus light & shadows both be killed''), triggering a strange vision in Yugi's mind concerning his Millennium Puzzle, the Pyramid of Light, Anubis, and Kaiba. After he wakes up, he finds the pyramid stolen, the sarcophagus now empty, and [[Mokuba Kaiba|Mokuba]] standing outside. Mokuba says that Kaiba wants Yugi to bring his [[Duel Disk|duel disk]] to the KaibaCorp Duel Dome immediately.\n\nYugi does so, transforming into [[Yami Yugi]] on the way, and finds Kaiba ready to duel. Seto asks Mokuba to seal all the exits, forcing Yugi to duel him, but not before [[Joey Wheeler]] and [[Tristan Taylor]] find their way in to watch.\n\nThe duel goes on for what seems like an eternity, and Yugi is starting to suspect that there are dark forces at work - especially when Kaiba [[activate]]s a [[Trap Card]] called the \"[[Pyramid of Light (anime)|Pyramid of Light]]\", which not only bears a striking resemblance to its namesake in the museum, but also prevents Yugi from using any of the Egyptian Gods! Before long, Kaiba has his \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\" on the [[field]], but to Yugi's surprise, he sacrifices it to [[Summon]] a [[monster]] known as the \"[[Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon]]\", which is even stronger!\n\nThe Pyramid of Light also pulls the souls of Yugi, Joey, and Tristan into Yugi's Millenium Puzzle, where they are chased by [[Mummy (character)|a group of mummies]] controlled by an unknown force...\n\nThe power of \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" brings Yugi to the verge of defeat, but Kaiba decides to humiliate his rival with the most ironic victory possible: wiping him out with his own Egyptian Gods! Having used \"Pyramid of Light\" to [[Banish|remove the gods from play]], he intends to use \"[[Return from the Different Dimension (anime)|Return from the Different Dimension]]\" to get them under his control - but first, he needs to [[destroy]] \"Pyramid of Light\", otherwise it would just destroy the gods again! Kaiba commands his \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" to use its \"Shining Nova\" [[effect]], which allows it to sacrifice itself to destroy anything on the field - and he aims it at the \"Pyramid of Light\". Suddenly, a ghostly voice calls out, \"''This I cannot allow!''\", and the Pyramid stays exactly where it is. Then, a man rises up from behind Kaiba, throws him aside, and takes over the duel himself.\n\nIt is [[Anubis]], the Egyptian Lord of the Dead, whom the Pharaoh destroyed 5000 years ago. But now he is back with the Pyramid of Light around his neck and two of his most powerful monsters - \"[[Andro Sphinx (anime)|Andro Sphinx]]\" and \"[[Sphinx Teleia (anime)|Sphinx Teleia]]\"! On top of this, Téa, Joey, Tristan and Yugi are all trapped inside the Millennium Puzzle, leaving the Pharaoh to duel all alone. Putting all his faith into the cards, Yugi draws the \"[[Double Spell (anime)|Double Spell]]\" card, which allows him to discard his other spell card to activate \"[[Monster Reborn (anime)|Monster Reborn]]\" from Seto's [[Graveyard]]. He uses it to revive \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\", who then destroys the \"Pyramid of Light\" (after it was weakened by Yugi from inside the Millennium Puzzle), along with \"Andro Sphinx\" and \"Sphinx Teleia\". But [[Anubis]] is not finished yet. With the Pyramid gone, he combines his fallen Sphinxes into a new, even stronger monster - \"[[Theinen the Great Sphinx (anime)|Theinen the Great Sphinx]]\"! Yugi, however, activates \"[[Reverse of Reverse]]\" to activate Kaiba's \"Return from the Different Dimension\". The God Monsters return and destroy the Great Sphinx, seemingly taking Anubis with it. But a giant jackal - the ancient Egyptian representation of Anubis, the Lord of the Dead - rises from the remains of the Pyramid!\n\nKaiba and Yugi join forces, putting all their strength into the \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" card, and using Shining Nova to destroy Anubis once and for all. On top of it all, Pegasus, who had earlier arrived via helicopter to help them, gets them out of the explosion in time.\n\n==Relation to the anime==\n[[File:Anubis PoL.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Anubis]]]]\nIt is unclear whether the movie is considered canon to the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime. Despite the supposed prominance of [[Anubis]] in the [[Pharaoh Atem|Pharaoh]]'s past, he never appeared outside of this movie—despite the \"[[Dawn of the Duel]]\" arc's exploration of the Pharaoh's past.\n\nThe movie debuted in the United States between episodes [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 138|138]] and [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 139|139]].\n\nThe movie is set after the [[Battle City]] finals,<ref name=\"4Kids announcement\"/> with Yugi wielding all three Egyptian God Cards in the movie. According to Animation World Network, the movie is set directly after [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 144|Episode 144]] (the final episode of the [[Battle City (part 2)|Battle City Finals]]).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Fred |title='Yu-Gi-Oh!': Anime Made In...

While this could indicate the movie takes place after [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 184|Episode 184]] (the final episode of the [[Waking the Dragons]] arc), it is likely just footage being reused (since Episode 183 had already aired in Japan prior to this movie's premiere).\n{{-|left}}\n\n==Release==\nThe movie was released in theaters in North America, Europe, and Australia. In the United States, the movie debuted on August 13, 2004. \n\nThe movie was not released theatrically in Japan. It was shown at special screenings in Japan on November 3, 2004. The movie aired on TV Tokyo on January 2, 2005. Notably, unlike in the United States, the movie debuted in Japan after the conclusion of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime.\n\nThe ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie Ani-Manga]]'' comic book was released in the United States on November 23, 2004. In English, it came with a \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (original)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\" promotional card.\n\nIn the United States, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie'' DVDs were released on November 16, 2004.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Upper Deck Entertainment |title=Yu-Gi-Oh!

The Movie'' VHS tapes and DVDs included the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! the Movie VHS and DVD promotional cards|promotional card]] \"[[Pyramid of Light]]\". In the United States, the VHS tapes and DVDs also included [[Yu-Gi-Oh! the Movie VHS and DVD promotional cards|mail-in-offer]], which customers could fill in to receive the other three ''Movie Pack'' cards.\n\nTwo fans managed to steal a box of 2,400 cards in California. Disguised as Warner Bros. workers, they made off with the cards, claiming that wrong cards were sent, and promising a new shipment.<ref>{{cite web  |url = http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/501140-yu_gi_oh_trading_cards_stolen  |title = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Pegasus' hand is shown to contain \"[[Toon Table of Contents (anime)|Toon Table of Contents]]\", \"[[Toon Summoned Skull (later anime)|Toon Summoned Skull]]\", \"[[Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon (later anime)|Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon]]\", \"[[Monster Reborn (anime)|Monster Reborn]]\", \"[[Cost Down (later anime)|Cost Down]]\", and \"[[Toon Dark Magician Girl (anime)|Toon Dark Magician Girl]]\". Kaiba's hand has \"Soul Release\", \"Z-Metal Tank\", \"Y-Dragon Head\", \"[[Ring of Destruction (anime)|Ring of Destruction]]\", \"Monster Reborn\", and \"[[Polymerization (anime)|Polymerization]]\".\n\nPegasus then activates \"Cost Down\", discarding \"Toon Table of Contents\" to lower the [[Level]] of every [[monster]] in his [[hand]] by two.  Pegasus then [[Normal Summon]]s \"Toon Dark Magician Girl\" ([[File:CG Star.svg|16px]] 6 → 4/2000/1700) in [[Attack Position]]. \"Toon-Gemini Elf\" attacks directly via its own effect as Kaiba controls no [[Toon monsters]] ([[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] 4000 → 2100). Since \"Toon-Gemini Elf\" inflicted [[battle damage]], its second effect activates, forcing Seto to discard \"Monster Reborn\".\n\n\"Toon Dark Magician Girl\" attacks directly via its own effect, but Seto activates his face-down \"Attack Guidance Armor\" to redirect the attack to \"Toon-Gemini Elf\" instead, destroying it ([[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]] 3000 → 2900). Pegasus activates \"Monster Reborn\" to revive \"Toon-Gemini Elf\" ([[File:CG Star.svg|16px]] 4 → 2/1900/900) in [[Attack Position]]. Pegasus then activates his face-down \"[[Ultimate Offering (anime)|Ultimate Offering]]\", which allows him to [[Normal Summon]] more than one [[monster]] during his Main Phases and Kaiba's Battle Phases at the [[cost]] of 500 [[Life Points]] for each extra monster Summoned.\n\nPegasus then Tributes \"Toon-Gemini Elf\" in order to [[Tribute Summon]] \"Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon\" ([[File:CG Star.svg|16px]] 8 → 6/3000/2500) in Attack Position ([[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]] 2900 → 2400). Pegasus then Normal Summons \"Toon Summoned Skull\" ([[File:CG Star.svg|16px]] 6 → 4/2500/1200) in Attack Position ([[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]] 2400 → 1900). On Pegasus' End Phase, the effect of \"Cost Down\" expires (\"Toon Dark Magician Girl\" and \"Toon Summoned Skull\": [[File:CG Star.svg|16px]] 4 → 6; \"Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon\": 6 → 8).\n\n<u>'''Turn 4: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"[[Dark Core (anime)|Dark Core]]\" and subsequently activates it to [[discard]] \"Y-Dragon Head\" and [[banish|remove]] \"X-Head Cannon\" from play. Kaiba then activates \"Soul Release\" to remove \"[[Y-Dragon Head (anime)|Y-Dragon Head]]\" in his [[Graveyard]] from play. Kaiba then [[Normal Summon]]s \"Z-Metal Tank\" (1500/1300) in [[Attack Position]].\n\nKaiba then activates his face-down \"Return from the Different Dimension\" to [[pay]] half his [[Life Points]] ([[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] 2100 → 1050) and [[Special Summon]] the removed from play \"X-Head Cannon\" (1800/1500) and \"Y-Dragon Head\" (1500/1600) in [[Attack Position]]. Kaiba then removes from play \"X-Head Cannon\", \"Y-Dragon Head\" and \"Z-Metal Tank\" to [[Special Summon]] \"[[XYZ-Dragon Cannon (anime)|XYZ-Dragon Cannon]]\" (2800/2600) in [[Attack Position]].\n\nKaiba then activates the effect of  \"XYZ-Dragon Cannon\" to discard one card and [[destroy]] \"Toon World\". Because \"Toon World\" is no longer in play, \"Toon Dark Magician Girl\", \"Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon\" and \"Toon Summoned Skull\" are all [[destroy]]ed. \"XYZ-Dragon Cannon\" [[attack]]s [[direct attack|directly]] ([[Maximillion Pegasus|Pegasus]] 1900 → 0).\n\n===Yami Yugi VS. Seto Kaiba/Anubis===\n[[File:MOV-Yugi-vs-Seto-Duel5.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Yami Yugi]] VS. [[Seto Kaiba]]]]\n<u>'''Turn 1: Kaiba'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 41 → 36)\nKaiba draws \"[[Deck Destruction Virus]]\". Kaiba's hand is shown to contain \"[[Mystical Space Typhoon (anime)|Mystical Space Typhoon]]\", \"[[Familiar Knight (anime)|Familiar Knight]]\", \"[[Rare Metal Dragon (anime)|Rare Metal Dragon]]\", \"[[Des Feral Imp (later anime)|Des Feral Imp]]\" and \"[[Peten the Dark Clown (anime)|Peten the Dark Clown]]\" and \"Deck Destruction Virus\". Kaiba then [[Normal Summon]]s \"Familiar Knight\" (1200/1400) in [[Defense Position]].\n\n<u>'''Turn 2: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 36 → 35)\nYami Yugi draws \"[[Mirror Force (later anime)|Mirror Force]]\". Yami Yugi's hand contains \"[[King's Knight (anime)|King's Knight]]\", \"[[Magician's Valkyria (anime)|Magician's Valkyria]]\", \"[[Premature Burial (anime)|Premature Burial]]\", \"[[Sage's Stone (later anime)|Sage's Stone]]\", \"[[Queen's Knight (anime)|Queen's Knight]]\", and \"Mirror Force\". Yami Yugi then [[Normal Summon]]s \"Queen's Knight\" (1500/1600) in [[Attack Position]].\n\n\"Queen's Knight\" [[attack]]s and [[destroy]]s \"Familiar Knight\". The effect of \"Familiar Knight\" then activates, letting both players Special Summon a Level 4 monster from their hand. [[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] [[Special Summon]]s \"Rare Metal Dragon\" (2400/1200) in [[Attack Position]] while [[Yami Yugi]] [[Special Summon]]s \"King's Knight\" (1600/1400) in [[Attack Position]]. \n\nThe effect of \"King's Knight\" then activates, letting Yami Yugi [[Special Summon]] \"[[Jack's Knight (anime)|Jack's Knight]]\" (1900/1000) from his [[Deck]] in [[Attack Position]] (Yami Yugi's Deck: 35 → 34). Yami Yugi [[Set]]s a card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 3: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"[[Pyramid of Light (anime)|Pyramid of Light]]\" and subsequently [[Set]]s it.\n\n<u>'''Turn 4: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 34 → 33)\nYami Yugi draws \"[[Slifer the Sky Dragon (later anime)|Slifer the Sky Dragon]]\". He then [[Tribute]]s \"Queen's Knight\", \"King's Knight\" and \"Jack's Knight\" in order to [[Tribute Summon]] \"Slifer the Sky Dragon\" (X000 [[ATK]] / X000 [[DEF]]) in [[Attack Position]]. \n\nDue to the effect of \"Slifer\", its ATK and DEF become equal the number of cards in Yami Yugi's hand times 1000. Yami Yugi currently has three (\"Slifer the Sky Dragon\": X000 → 3000/X000 → 3000).\n\n\"Slifer\" [[attack]]s and [[destroy]]s \"Rare Metal Dragon\" ([[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] 4000 → 3400).\n\n<u>'''Turn 5: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"[[Obligatory Summon]]\" and subsequently activates it to force [[Yami Yugi]] to [[Special Summon]] all monsters from his [[Deck]] with the same [[Attribute]] as the [[monster]] he [[control]]s. Yami Yugi Special Summons \"[[Obelisk the Tormentor (later anime)|Obelisk the Tormentor]]\" (4000/4000) and \"[[The Winged Dragon of Ra (later anime)|The Winged Dragon of Ra]]\" (? → 0/? → 0) in Attack Position. (Yami Yugi's Deck: 33 → 31)\n\nKaiba then activates his face-down \"Pyramid of Light\" to remove the Egyptian Gods from play. At this point, \"Pyramid of Light\"  envelops the playing [[field]], which prevents both Yami Yugi and [[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] from exiting until the [[Duel]] is over. Whenever Yami Yugi or Seto lose [[Life Points]], their actual life energy is drained from them and used to feed [[Anubis]]. \n\nA Dark Red Eye appears on the side of the pyramid, absorbing the souls of [[Joey Wheeler|Joey]] and [[Tristan Taylor|Tristan]]. They are transported to Yugi's [[Millennium Puzzle]]. [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]]'s own soul is absorbed within his [[Millennium Puzzle]], leaving Yami Yugi to [[Duel]] against Seto by himself. The stadium where Yami Yugi and Seto are dueling begins to collapse, but the \"Pyramid of Light\" protects them from the debris.\n\nSeto activates \"Mystical Space Typhoon\" to destroy Yami Yugi's [[Set]] card (noted to have been \"Mirror Force\" in the Japanese version). He then [[Normal Summon]]s \"Peten the Dark Clown\" (500/1200) in [[Attack Position]]. \"Peten the Dark Clown\" [[attack]]s [[direct attack|directly]] ([[Yami Yugi|Yami]] 4000 → 3500). Kaiba [[Set]]s a card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 6: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 31 → 30)\nYami Yugi draws. He then [[Normal Summon]]s \"Magician's Valkyria\" (1600/1800) in Attack Position. \"Magician's Valkyria\" then [[attack]]s and [[destroy]]s \"Peten the Dark Clown\" ([[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] 3400 → 2300).\n\nKaiba then activates his face-down \"Deck Destruction Virus\". Now whenever a [[DARK]] [[Fiend]]-[[Type]] monster with at most 500 ATK is destroyed by battle, this card will force Yami Yugi to send ten random cards in his Deck to the Graveyard. The effect of \"Deck Destruction Virus\" activates (Yami Yugi's Deck: 30 → 20).\n\nSince \"Peten the Dark Clown\" was sent to the Graveyard, Kaiba removes it from play in order to [[Special Summon]] another \"Peten the Dark Clown\" (500/1200) from his [[Deck]] in [[Defense Position]]. \n\n<u>'''Turn 7: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"[[Card of Demise (anime)|Card of Demise]]\". He then [[Normal Summon]]s \"Des Feral Imp\" (1600/1800) in [[Defense Position]]. Kaiba then [[activate]]s \"Card of Demise\" to draw until he has five cards in his [[hand]] (his hand is empty so he draws five cards). Five [[turn]]s after the activation of \"Card of Demise\", [[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] must [[discard]] his entire [[hand]] during his Standby Phase. Kaiba's hand now contains \"[[Polymerization (anime)|Polymerization]]\", \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\", \"[[Attack Guidance Armor (anime)|Attack Guidance Armor]]\", \"[[Paladin of White Dragon (anime)|Paladin of White Dragon]]\", and \"[[White Dragon Ritual (anime)|White Dragon Ritual]]\".\n\nKaiba activates \"White Dragon Ritual\" to Tribute \"Des Feral Imp\" and [[Ritual Summon]] \"Paladin of White Dragon\" (1900/1200) from his [[hand]] in [[Attack Position]]. \"Paladin of White Dragon\" [[attack]]s and [[destroy]]s \"Magician's Valkyria\" ([[Yami Yugi|Yami]] 3500 → 3200).\n\nKaiba then activates the second effect of \"Paladin of White Dragon\" to Tribute itself and [[Special Summon]] \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" (3000/2500) from his [[Deck]] in [[Attack Position]]. Kaiba then [[Set]]s a card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 8: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 20 → 19)\nYami Yugi draws. He then [[activate]]s \"Premature Burial\" to Special Summon \"Magician's Valkyria\" (1600/1800) from his Graveyard in Attack Position and equip it with \"Premature Burial\" by paying 800 Life Points ([[Yami Yugi|Yami]] 3200 → 2400).\n\nYami Yugi then activates \"[[Mage Power (anime)|Mage Power]]\" and equips it to \"Magician's Valkyria\". Now as long as \"Magician's Valkyria\" is equipped with \"Mage Power\", it will gain 500 [[ATK]] and [[DEF]] for every [[Spell Cards|Spell]] and [[Trap Card]] on Yami Yugi's side of the [[field]] (\"Magician's Valkyria\": 1600 → 2600/1800 → 2800). Yami Yugi then [[Set]]s two cards (\"Magician's Valkyria\": 2600 → 3600/2800 → 3800).\n\n\"Magician's Valkyria\" [[attack]]s \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", but [[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] activates his face-down \"Attack Guidance Armor\" to redirect the attack to \"Peten the Dark Clown\". \"Magician's Valkyria\" then destroys \"Peten the Dark Clown\". The effect of \"Deck Destruction Virus\" activates (Yami Yugi's Deck: 19 → 9) (Noted that one of the destroyed cards was ''Dark Magician Girl'').\n\nKaiba then removes \"Peten the Dark Clown\" from play in order to [[Special Summon]] another \"Peten the Dark Clown\" (500/1200) from his [[Deck]] in [[Defense Position]]. \n\n<u>'''Turn 9: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\". Seto activates \"Polymerization\" to fuse the \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\" on his field with the two copies in his [[hand]] in order to [[Fusion Summon]] \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon]]\" (4500/3800) in [[Attack Position]]. \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" [[attack]]s & [[destroy]]s \"Magician's Valkyria\" ([[Yami Yugi|Yugi]] 2400 → 1500).\n\n<u>'''Turn 10: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 9 → 8)\nYami Yugi draws. He then activates his face-down \"[[Monster Reborn (anime)|Monster Reborn]]\" to [[Special Summon]] \"[[Dark Magician Girl (anime)|Dark Magician Girl]]\" (2000/1700) from his Graveyard in [[Attack Position]]. Yami Yugi then activates face-down \"Sage's Stone\" to [[Special Summon]] \"[[Dark Magician (anime)|Dark Magician]]\" (2500/2100) from his [[Deck]] in [[Attack Position]] (Yami Yugi's Deck: 8 → 7). Yami Yugi then [[Tribute]]s \"Dark Magician Girl\" and \"Dark Magician\" in order to [[Special Summon]] \"[[Sorcerer of Dark Magic (anime)|Sorcerer of Dark Magic]]\" (3200/2800) from his [[hand]] in [[Attack Position]].\n\n\"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\" then [[attack]]s \"[[Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eye Ultimate Dragon]]\". The second effect of \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\" then activates, decreasing the ATK of \"Blue-Eye Ultimate Dragon\" by 500 for each [[Spellcaster]]-[[Type]] monster in Yami Yugi's Graveyard that was sent there from the field. There are currently three: \"Dark Magician Girl\", \"Dark Magician\", and \"Magician's Valkyria\" (\"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\": 4500 → 3000/3800). \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\" destroys \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" ([[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] 2300 → 2100).\n\n<u>'''Turn 11: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws. Kaiba then passes.\n\n<u>'''Turn 12: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 7 → 6)\nYami Yugi draws. \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\" attacks and destroys Seto's \"Peten the Dark Clown\". The effect of \"Deck Destruction Virus\" activates, but the first effect of \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\" negates the effect of \"Deck Destruction Virus\" and destroys it.\n\n<u>'''Turn 13: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"[[Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon]]\". Kaiba then activates \"Monster Reborn\" to [[Special Summon]] \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" (4500/3800) from his [[Graveyard]] in [[Attack Position]]. Seto then Tributes \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\" in order to [[Special Summon]] \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" (3000/2500) in [[Attack Position]]. Due to the first effect of \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\", it gains 300 ATK for each Dragon in Kaiba's Graveyard. There are currently five (\"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\": 3000 → 4500/2500).\n\n\"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" attacks Yugi's \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\". The second effect of \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\" would activate at this point, but Kaiba activates the second effect of \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" to negate the effect of \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\". \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" then destroys \"Sorcerer of Dark Magic\" (Yami Yugi 1500 → 200).\n\n<u>'''Turn 14: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 6 → 5)\nYami Yugi draws \"[[Big Shield Gardna (anime)|Big Shield Gardna]]\" and subsequently Normal Summons it (100/2600) in [[Defense Position]].\n\n<u>'''Turn 15: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"[[Return from the Different Dimension (anime)|Return from the Different Dimension]]\" and subsequently sets it. \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" attacks & destroys Yugi's \"Big Shield Gardna\".\n\n<u>'''Turn 16: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 5 → 4)\nYami Yugi draws \"[[Pot of Greed (anime)|Pot of Greed]]\" and subsequently activates it to draw two cards (Yami Yugi's Deck: 4 → 2). Since Yami Yugi added \"[[Watapon (later anime)|Watapon]]\" from his Deck to his hand by a card effect, he Special Summons it (200/300) in [[Defense Position]]. Yami Yugi then Normal Summons \"[[Obnoxious Celtic Guardian (anime)|Obnoxious Celtic Guardian]]\" (1400/1200) in [[Defense Position]].\n\n<u>'''Turn 17: Kaiba'''</u><br />\nKaiba draws \"[[Spear Dragon (anime)|Spear Dragon]]\". On Kaiba's Standby Phase, the second effect of \"Card of Demise\" activates, forcing Kaiba to discard his entire hand (\"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\": 4500 → 4800/2500).\n\nKaiba activates the third effect of \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" to Tribute itself and destroy \"Pyramid of Light\" (Kaiba intends to use his set card to use Yugi's own [[Egyptian God]] cards against him so he can have a perfect victory). However, [[Anubis]] uses his power to prevent the \"Pyramid of Light\" from being destroyed. Anubis then appears and tosses Kaiba aside in order to take his place in the Duel ([[Life Points]] included).\n\n[[File:MOV-Yugi-vs-Anubis-Duel5.jpg|thumb|right|550px|Yami Yugi vs. Anubis]]\n\n<u>'''Turn 17: Anubis (Kaiba's Turn continued)'''</u><br />\nAnubis [[Special Summon]]s \"[[Andro Sphinx (anime)|Andro Sphinx]]\" (3000/2500) and \"[[Sphinx Teleia (anime)|Sphinx Teleia]]\" (2500/3000) from his [[Main Deck|Deck]] in [[Attack Position]] as \"Pyramid of Light\" is present on the field.\n\n<u>'''Turn 18: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 2 → 1)\nYami Yugi draws \"[[Reverse of Reverse]]\". He then Sets a card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 19: Anubis'''</u><br />\nAnubis Sets a card. \"Sphinx Teleia\" attacks & destroys Yugi's \"Obnoxious Celtic Guardian\" (as it can negate the effects of monsters it battles). \"Andro Sphinx\" attacks & destroys Yugi's \"Watapon\". The third effect of \"Andro Sphinx\" activates, inflicting damage to Yami Yugi equal to half the ATK of his destroyed monster ([[Yami Yugi|Yami]] 200 → 100).\n\n<u>'''Turn 20: Yami Yugi'''</u><br />\n(Yami Yugi's Deck: 1 → 0)\nYami Yugi draws \"[[Double Spell (later anime)|Double Spell]]\". At this point, [[Yugi Muto]] uses the \"Dagger of Fate\" to destroy the Eye within Anubis' [[Pyramid of Light (Item)|Pyramid of Light]]. This action exposes a weakness in the \"Pyramid of Light\" card, which Yami Yugi senses. Yami Yugi then activates \"Double Spell\" to activate \"Monster Reborn\" from Seto's [[Graveyard]] and [[Special Summon]] \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" (3000/2500) from Kaiba's Graveyard to his side of the field in [[Attack Position]] by discarding \"[[Exchange (anime)|Exchange]]\".\n\nYami Yugi then activates the third effect of \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" to Tribute itself and destroy Seto/Anubis's \"Pyramid of Light\". This time, \"Pyramid of Light\" is destroyed. With \"Pyramid of Light\" removed from the field, the souls of Yugi, Joey, Tristan, and Téa are returned to their bodies and Anubis's \"Andro Sphinx\" and \"Sphinx Teleia\" are destroyed.\n\nSince \"Andro Sphinx\" and \"Sphinx Teleia\" were destroyed at the same time, Anubis activates the effect of his face-down \"[[Theinen the Great Sphinx (anime)|Theinen the Great Sphinx]]\" and [[Special Summon]]s it (3500/3000) in Attack Position by paying 1000 Life Points (Anubis 2100 → 1100). Anubis then activates the second effect of \"Theinen\" in order to increase its ATK by the ATK of all monsters in his Graveyard (\"Theinen the Great Sphinx\": 3500 → 35000/3000) by paying 1000 Life Points (Anubis 1100 → 100). (In the dub, Anubis activates the Pyramid of Light around his neck to release the dead souls trapped within the Pyramid of Light and the Millennium Puzzle and infuse their power into \"Theinen\".)\n\nYami Yugi activates face-down \"[[Reverse of Reverse]]\" to activate Seto's face-down \"Return from the Different Dimension\" as his card, allowing Yami Yugi to [[Special Summon]] the [[banish|removed from play]] \"Obelisk the Tormentor\" (4000/4000), Slifer the Sky Dragon\" (X000 → 0/X000 → 0), and \"The Winged Dragon of Ra\" (? → 0/? → 0) in Attack Position by paying half his Life Points ([[Yami Yugi]] 100 → 50).\n\nYami Yugi then Tributes \"Slifer\" and \"Ra\" to activate the effect of \"Obelisk\" (\"Obelisk the Tormentor\": 4000 → ∞/4000), attacking and destroying \"Theinen the Great Sphinx\" ([[Anubis]] 100 → 0).\n\n==Featured cards==\nThe following cards were used in the film.

The Japanese version is 101 minutes long, whereas the English version is 90 minutes long. In the English version, many scenes from the Japanese version were omitted, switched, or altered.\n\n* All cards have full card text, localized to the language of the film. \n** This is in contrast to dubbed episodes of the anime, in which cards are edited to not use text at all. ''Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Darkside of Dimensions]]'' are the media within the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime to display English card text in the English dub.\n*** The reason for this is speculated to be [[wikipedia:Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations in the United States.\n** The cards in the movie also retained the visual rarity that their real-world card game counterparts have, with the rarer cards having gold lettering on them to match those of an Ultra Rare card.\n** In the English dub, [[Spell Card|Magic Card]]s display \"Spell Card\" on their text, despite still being referred to as Magic Cards.\n\n* The Life Point counters used in the main Duel of the film are the same used in the original Japanese series.\n\n* In Japanese, the Pharaoh's past takes place 3000 years ago. In the English translation, it instead takes place in 3000 B.C. (5000 years ago).\n\n* The \"Dagger of Fate\" was a plot device added to the English dub to give meaning to Yugi throwing it at the eye inside of the Millennium Puzzle. In the Japanese version, the dagger was never mentioned at all before that scene and Yugi just needed to find a hard object to throw at the eye and break it.\n\n* In the English dub, Anubis is heard speaking in Ancient Egyptian on several occasions. In the Japanese version, he seldom spoke the language.\n\n==Errors==\n===Visual errors===\n[[File:MOV Winged Dragon of Ra Error.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 2 copies of \"[[The Winged Dragon of Ra (later anime)|The Winged Dragon of Ra]]\"]]\n\n* When the duel between Seto and Pegasus begins, the latter is shown with 4 cards in his [[hand]].\n\n* The \"[[Injection Fairy Lily (anime)|Injection Fairy Lily]]\" card is displayed either vertically-reversed or placed upside-down while horizontally-reversed.\n\n* When Kaiba has his computer run a simulation of a duel between him and Yugi, Yugi is listed as using \"[[Paladin of White Dragon (anime)|Paladin of White Dragon]]\".\n\n* When \"[[Familiar Knight (anime)|Familiar Knight]]\" is attacked, the card underneath is reversed.\n\n* In the English version, when Yami Yugi Summons \"[[King's Knight (anime)|King's Knight]]\", the entire screen is mirrored (causing the cards of \"King's Knight\" and \"Queen's Knight\" to also be mirrored).\n\n* In the Japanese version of the movie, when Yami Yugi Summons \"[[Magician's Valkyria (anime)|Magician's Valkyria]]\" and attacks \"Peten the Dark Clown\", he is briefly shown to have \"Magician's Valkyria\" with \"[[Premature Burial (anime)|Premature Burial]]\", \"[[Mage Power (anime)|Mage Power]]\" and 2 [[face-down]] cards. However, that's the [[field]] he has 1 turn later, when he revives \"Magician's Valkyria\" to face \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\".\n\n* In the English version, when Seto Kaiba Summons \"[[Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon]]\", its card is mirrored.\n\n* In the English version of the movie, during Yami Yugi's final turn after his [[Draw Phase]], \"[[Exchange (anime)|Exchange]]\" and \"[[Diffusion Wave-Motion (anime)|Diffusion Wave-Motion]]\" are visible in his [[hand]]. In the Japanese version of the movie, it was fixed to show \"Exchange\" and \"[[Double Spell (later anime)|Double Spell]]\" instead.\n\n* When Anubis activates \"[[Inferno Tempest (anime)|Inferno Tempest]]\" and \"[[Fallout]]\" to make Yami Yugi and Seto Kaiba drop all of their cards, 2 copies of \"The Winged Dragon of Ra\" are shown flying out of Yami Yugi's Duel Disk.\n\n* Several cards shown in the movie do not have the proper font for their card names when their cards are played.\n\n* When Seto and Pegasus draw due to \"[[Card of Sanctity (anime)|Card of Sanctity]]\", \"[[Dark Magician Girl (anime)|Dark Magician Girl]]\" can be see in Pegasus's [[hand]] instead of \"[[Toon Dark Magician Girl (anime)|Toon Dark Magician Girl]]\".\n\n* The incorrect typeface is used for the names of several cards, including \"Magician's Valkyria\" and \"Toon Summoned Skull\".\n\n===Ruling errors===\n* When [[Joey Wheeler|Joey]] challenges a group of [[Duelist]]s wanting to have a go at [[Yugi Muto|Yugi]] and his [[Egyptian God]] cards, the first challenger Summons \"Injection Fairy Lily\" on the first turn, and declares an attack with it despite the player who goes first being unable to conduct the [[Battle Phase]]. \n\n* When \"[[Peten the Dark Clown (anime)|Peten the Dark Clown]]\" is [[destroyed by battle]], Kaiba activates \"[[Deck Destruction Virus]]\", which can only be activated when a ''[[Fiend]]-[[Type]]'' [[Monster Card|Monster]] with 500 [[ATK]] or less is destroyed by battle. \"Peten the Dark Clown\" is a [[Spellcaster]]-[[Type]] monster.\n\n* When Kaiba Summons \"[[Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon]]\", he explained that it gains 300 ATK points for every Dragon-Type monster he has in his Graveyard, and stated that he had five, being \"[[Rare Metal Dragon (anime)|Rare Metal Dragon]]\", 3 \"[[Blue-Eyes White Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes White Dragon]]\", and \"Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon\". However, this is an error as \"Paladin of White Dragon\" is also a Dragon-Type monster, and therefore should mean that Kaiba has ''six'' Dragon-Type monsters in his Graveyard, and thus the ATK of \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" should have been 4800, not 4500. This would also mean that when \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" attacked and destroyed \"[[Sorcerer of Dark Magic (anime)|Sorcerer of Dark Magic]]\", Yami Yugi's Life Points would have dropped to 0, losing the Duel. \n\n* When Kaiba uses the \"Shining Nova\" effect of \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" to destroy \"Pyramid of Light\", although the [[attack]] failed, \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" disappears, and later Yami Yugi activates \"Monster Reborn\" to Special Summon it from the Graveyard. However, \"Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon\" is shown to appear next to Anubis for a short time, after it had already been destroyed following the activation of its [[effect]].\n\n===Other errors===\n* When Yugi uses Kaiba's \"Return from the Different Dimension\", he mentions that Kaiba wanted \"a perfect victory\", but Kaiba never actually said that—he only thought it.\n\n*In the beginning of the movie, it is stated that Yugi defeated [[Seto Kaiba]] to win the finals of the [[Battle City]] Duel Monsters tournament. However, Yugi's true opponent for the final of the tournament was against [[Marik Ishtar]] / [[Dark Marik]] as all scenes that follow the headline show Yugi receiving The Winged Dragon of Ra from Marik.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dan Green]] as Yugi Muto, Yami Yugi\n*[[Greg Abbey]] as Tristan Taylor\n*[[Wayne Grayson]] as Joey Wheeler\n*[[Tara Jayne]] as Mokuba Kaiba\n*[[Amy Birnbaum]] as Tea Gardner\n*[[Eric Stuart]] as Seto Kaiba\n*[[Scottie Ray]] as Anubis\n*[[Charles Rocket]] as Narrator\n\n==Music==\nThe musical score and the sound effects are all completely brand new and American-made. There is no original Japanese music or sound effects in the English dub of the movie.\n\nThe ending theme for the Japanese version of the film is [[Fire (song)|Fire]], which is sung & composed by Blaze.\n\nThe musical score (background instrumentals) was released for the Japanese version of the movie. While the score for the English version was never officially released, [[Joel Douek]], one of the series' composers for the dub, unofficially released these tracks on his YouTube account and FTP.\n\n==Posters==\n<gallery>\nPyramidofLightPoster.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n* In contrast to dubbed episodes of the ''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' anime, ''Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light'' featured substantially more violence:\n** Contrary to the usual concept of [[Shadow Realm]], the words \"kill\" and \"die\" are used. \"Die\" is used by [[Anubis]], \"Killed\" is used by Solomon Muto's reading of the prophecy.\n** Violent comments like \"''Soon worms will feast your flesh, just as they did on mine''\" and \"''You will be destroyed''\" are used by [[Anubis]]. \n** No censorship is applied on mummies being dismembered or Yugi's silhouette being \"stabbed\" by \"[[Peten the Dark Clown (anime)|Peten the Dark Clown]]\". \n** The cards are displayed in their [[TCG]] form, but \"[[Dark Magician Girl (anime)|Dark Magician Girl]]\" displays a pentagram (as per the original card) instead of her usual censored \"ruby\".\n** \"[[Injection Fairy Lily (anime)|Injection Fairy Lily]]\" also rides a syringe, as opposed to the rocket she rides in the dubbed anime.\n** Pegasus makes a direct reference to \"wine spritzers\", where alcoholic beverages are usually changed to something else in the dub (usually fruit juice).\n** Near the end, Kaiba says the word \"bull\" (short for the swear word). This is as close as the English dub got to a swear word, unless the word \"crap\" is considered in the same category.\n\n* A few times during the movie, [[Seto Kaiba]]'s hair glowed green, which could be a homage to the Toei anime.\n\n* In the newspaper Solomon reads near the start of the movie, a picture is credited to [[Norman Grossfeld]]—the writer and executive producer of the movie.\n\n* In the beginning of the movie, a group of archaeologists discovered Anubis's tomb. Their appearance is similar to the archaeologists who discovered the [[Millennium Puzzle]] in the first episode of the [[Yu-Gi-Oh! (Toei anime)|Toei anime]].\n\n* Though elements of the ''[[Dawn of the Duel]]'' story arc from season 5 of the show are used, the plot of this film greatly mirrors that of the ''[[Waking the Dragons]]'' story arc from season 4. An ancient enemy arises and uses the Pharaoh's power against him in some way, they possess a powerful artifact and use its card counterpart to surround the field and prevent any interference, Yugi is prevented from using the God Cards until the end, after the enemy loses the final duel from a combined attack of 3 Legendary Monsters they take the form of or combine with a great beast to attack Yugi and his friends (Joey even uses some of the same monsters to fight both), the enemy uses Pegasus to manipulate Kaiba when he seeks him out for answers, Pegasus later shows up to provide background information and other answers for Yugi and/or his friends, and Yugi and the Pharaoh are separated for a sizable portion of the story and are only reunited once the enemy suffers some form of defeat and loses what was originally going to be the source of power for their attack on the world.\n\n* Many cards use their first English ''TCG'' text, regardless of any errata applied in subsequent reprints.\n\n* After Kaiba defeats Pegasus, he says \"That's all Folks!\", referencing the Warner Bros. catchphrase to mock Pegasus's Toon Deck. \n\n* When Tristan sees the mummies for the first time, he yells \"Zoinks!\", the iconic exclamation of Shaggy Rogers from \"Scooby-Doo\".\n\n* An image of \"[[Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon (anime)|Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon]]\" appears on the label of Pegasus's red wine bottle.\n\n* This is the only Yu-Gi-Oh! movie where a \"[[Red-Eyes]]\" monster did not appear.\n\n* A scene at the start of the movie shows Yugi's completion of the Millennium Puzzle, matching a flashback in [[Yu-Gi-Oh! - Episode 180|Episode 180]] (which had already aired in Japan when this movie debuted). Notably, the backstory seen in these two episodes differs from the backstory given in the manga.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/yu-gi-oh-movie Yu-Gi-Oh!

VRAINS]]'' anime. It is initially introduced as a robot built by [[Yusaku Fujiki]] to serve as a maid for [[Yusaku Fujiki's house|his house]], before interaction with [[Ai]] allowed it to develop free will. In doing so, they developed a brotherly relationship with Ai. They would eventually evolve further and work alongside Ai as the secondary antagonist of the third season.\n\n==Design==\n===Appearance===\n{{double image|left\n|Roboppi Original Form.png|177\n|Roboppi Human Form.png|150\n|Roboppi in robot form and 'human' form.\n}}\nRoboppi is a small robot, not even knee-high to Yusaku. It has a spherical baby blue head with a black screen for a face with yellow rectangular eyes and \"horns\" that curve around the sides of its head with orange tips and pink bands. The baby blue body is roughly triangular; widening as it reaches the floor, and has a dark blue band surrounding its wheels, with a white pouch. Its small arms are tipped with pink hands consisting of a thumb and palm.\n\nIn his human form, Roboppi has the appearance of a small boy with yellow eyes, and has baby-blue hair with an orange underlayer in a style resembling his robot form, with pink wicks on the \"horns\" of hair. Like Ai, Roboppi has a diamond shape at his throat and back—a yellow one. After hijacking a waiter [[SOLtiS|SOL''ti''S]], Roboppi wears a white shirt with a black bowtie, a charcoal waistcoat, and black pants and charcoal shoes. In digital worlds, Roboppi dresses casually in baggy clothes in a similar color scheme to his former body: a blue hoodie with a black chest, a white collar with a black line running across the circumference, red forearms (similar to the robot form's pink hands) and gold cuffs, a yellow undershirt, light blue pants with the left pocket lined with a red and white strip, and white shoes. When he goes wild during their Duel with [[Theodore Hamilton|Soulburner]], his irises shrink and become outlined in red, and his facial expressions turn feral.\n\n===Personality===\nAs a non-sentient robot, Roboppi's personality is initially very basic until [[Ai]] begins to make it smarter. It quickly becomes attached to and adoring of Ai, assisting him to a degree. When Ai left for the [[Cyberse (world)|Cyberse]], Roboppi pined for him, and was happy when he returned, but demonstrated some jealousy towards \"[[Linkuriboh (character)|Linkuriboh]]\". Roboppi is very polite, greeting [[Cal Kolter]] and [[Theodore Hamilton]] happily when they first met them.\n\nAfter gaining free will, Roboppi acts in a constantly giddy and peppy manner, developing a sibling's relationship with Ai in comparison to his more romantic-seeming relationship while Roboppi was still just a robot. Having seen what humanity has done to the planet, he decides that humans are \"the worst creatures\", claiming that he wants to defeat them all and become stronger, allowing him to clean the world in peace and \"raise his ranking\". However, the rapid manner in which Roboppi gained his intelligence prevented him from maturing accordingly, and he acts arrogantly and insufferably about his skills. This emotional instability and arrogance rapidly becomes worse and worse, to the point where Roboppi went utterly wild during his Duel with Soulburner and stupidly declares that they could even defeat Ai. In the dub it is suggested that this corrupted Roboppi's true desires as Roboppi stops himself from attacking to protect their friend.\n\n===Voice/Mannerisms===\nRoboppi uses the personal pronoun of \"oira\", a casual masculine pronoun, but later also refers to himself with the gender neutral \"ii ko\", which can mean \"good boy\" or \"good girl\". Before his Duel with Ghost Gal and The Shepherd, Pandor refers to Roboppi with the male pronoun \"kare\". After going wild during their Duel with Soulburner, Roboppi refers to themself with the personal pronoun \"ore\". At the peak of their insanity, Roboppi uses the highly arrogant pronoun \"ore-sama\".\n\nIn the dub, Roboppi speaks with a more mechanical voice during the first season but switches to a whimsical tone from the second season onwards. When he goes wild, his speech becomes more mechanical and sneering.\n\n==Biography==\n===Knights of Hanoi===\nRoboppi was first seen cleaning [[Yusaku Fujiki|Yusaku's]] bedroom. [[Ai]] called it an idiot; Roboppi replied that \"idiot\" was a forbidden word. Ai asked Roboppi if it wanted to be smarter, but their actions were cut short when Yusaku arrived home early and Roboppi put the [[Duel Disk]] containing Ai on top of the shelf.<ref name=\"ep3\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|3|ref}}</ref> After Yusaku defeated [[Varis]], Ai's body was restored, and he showed himself off to Roboppi, making himself appear muscular and praising how he could appear cool to \"dumb robot\". Robopi told him off for saying a forbidden word, and Ai promised that now that he was complete, he'd make Roboppi smarter.<ref name=\"ep13\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|13|ref}}</ref> As they carried out their secret play, Roboppi warned Ai that he was being too loud, though Ai dismissed its concerns until Yusaku came in, and Roboppi only just threw Ai in the Duel Disk back into place in time.<ref name=\"ep14\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|14|ref}}</ref> After Yusaku and Ai infiltrated [[SOL Technologies]]' data bank, Ai recapped the events to Roboppi at home, which interested Roboppi as it had helped Ai with his \"secret things\". Ai credited himself for some of Playmaker's contributions, amazing Roboppi, until he claimed he wished everyone to fight, with him as the bet. He claimed Playmaker was a fiend, though Roboppi stated he was just cold-hearted. After he told the story, Ai admitted he was uncertain what would they do next, since nobody else but Dr. Kogami knew about the incident.<ref name=\"ep21\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|21|ref}}</ref> \n\nRoboppi later modified Yusaku's Duel Disk to function as a drone, allowing Ai some freedom in the real world.<ref name=\"ep27\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|27|ref}}</ref> \n\n===Ignis===\n[[Ai]] vanished after the [[Tower of Hanoi]] was stopped, and Roboppi pined for him, wondering where he'd gone and why he'd left it all alone.<ref name=\"ep47\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|47|ref}}</ref> Ai returned after three months, making Roboppi happy, and he brought \"[[Linkuriboh (character)|Linkuriboh]]\" with him. Roboppi admitted that it thought Ai had abandoned it when he returned to his homeworld, and Ai reassured her that he'd never do that. Roboppi agreed, reminding Ai that he'd promised to make it smarter, and Ai called it his precious minion, stating that if it did as he said, it would be smarter in no time. Roboppi then asked who \"Linkuriboh\" was, and Ai introduced it as one of his minions. Roboppi asked if this meant they were rivals, and as it and \"Linkuriboh\" glared at one another, Ai commented that it was hard being a popular AI.<ref name=\"ep50\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|50|ref}}</ref>\n\nRoboppi and Ai later looked at fan posts in a chat forum, and Ai started posting that Playmaker was only great because of him. It stated that Ai was boasting about himself, as he'd sent twenty messages in that forum, and Ai protested that he was only telling the truth. [[Yusaku Fujiki|Yusaku]] walked in and asked what they were talking about, and Ai claimed they were just talking about his popularity, before noticing a message that claimed to be from the [[Earth (character)|EARTH Ignis]].<ref name=\"ep66\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|66|ref}}</ref> Another day, they found a site with a crossword puzzle that offered an Ai pin as a reward, but when Ai solved it he vanished from Yusaku's [[Duel Disk]]. Roboppi wondered where he'd gone, and told Yusaku that he was missing when he walked in. Yusaku took Roboppi to [[Café Nom]], the first time that Roboppi had been outside, and it marveled at the outside world. It saw the hotdog van, and asked if that was where Yusaku often went. Yusaku introduced Roboppi to [[Kal Kolter]], [[Theodore Hamilton]] and [[Flame (character)|Flame]], and Roboppi greeted them politely. Kolter began analyzing Ai and Roboppi's web history, and Roboppi explained what they'd been doing. Kolter brought up a site that an Ignis algorithm directed them to, and Yusaku logged into it.<ref name=\"ep68\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|68|ref}}</ref>\n\nOne night, Ai noted that they would have to defeat the Light Ignis, [[Lightning]], soon, and Roboppi noted that Yusaku had been busy. Ai was worried something bad might happen, though Roboppi encouraged him to fight. Ai promised to fulfill his promise to make Roboppi smarter, and he left a backup of himself in Roboppi.<ref name=\"ep84\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|84|ref}}</ref><ref name=\"ep102\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|102|ref}}</ref>\n\nAs Ai had promised, this backup did indeed alter Roboppi's capabilities, allowing it to receive Frog and Pigeon's broadcast of Playmaker and Bohman's final Duel. Though it found its new function strange, Roboppi encouraged its master and bro to do their best.<ref name=\"ep99\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|99|ref}}</ref> Ai sacrificed himself during the Duel to stop Bohman's Neuron Link, much to Roboppi's dismay.<ref name=\"ep101\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|101|ref}}</ref> As Roboppi panicked over Ai's death, it found itself transported to a large door that looked fun and pressed the button to open it. Roboppi was consumed by a wave of darkness, releasing Ai's backup and reviving him.<ref name=\"ep102\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|102|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Ai===\n[[Ai]]'s backup affected Roboppi, giving it sentience and free will and dramatically increasing its intelligence. It left its physical body behind and fled with Ai and [[Linkuriboh (character)|Linguriboh]] into the network, taking on human appearances and visiting the [[Cyberse (world)|Cyberse]].<ref name=\"ep104\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|104|ref}}</ref> As a result of his new intelligence, Roboppi viewed the actions of humanity and reached the conclusion that they were the worst creatures on [[Earth (planet)|Earth]] and that they needed to be eliminated to clean the Earth up.<ref name=\"ep106\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|106|ref}}</ref> Ai decided to battle humanity after making a discovery in the Cyberse, and Roboppi eagerly joined forces with him. They inhabited two [[SOLtiS|SOL''ti''S]] androids, Roboppi hacking the ship's computer to ensure they couldn't be traced. As they explored the cruise liner they found themselves on, Roboppi continued to marvel at the new sensations they were experiencing and the new facets of humanity that he was introduced to in the ship's casino. Roboppi easily won a game in the casino by influencing the pictures, though Ai criticized Roboppi's non-commitment to doing so spectacularly and manipulated every slot machine in the casino, showering them with coins. Taking advantage of the confusion, Ai and Roboppi headed to [[Queen]]'s room, and Ai took Queen to a digital world to Duel her for her key to [[SOL Technologies]]. Roboppi acted as a commentator during the Duel, much to both Ai and Queen's exasperation, celebrating Ai's moves as he overpowered Queen. Queen cheated by using her \"[[Honey Trap]]\" [[Skill]] during the [[Master Duel]], much to Roboppi's dismay, though Ai still defeated Queen.<ref name=\"ep104\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|104|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving a message for [[Akira Zaizen]] at the cruise liner warning him of their intentions, Roboppi and Ai enacted their plan to take Zaizen's key three days after defeating Queen. They identified ten Duelists who had assembled to stop them from getting to Zaizen; [[Skye Zaizen|Blue Maiden]], [[Theodore Hamilton|Soulburner]], [[Roken Kogami|Varis]], [[Spectre]], [[Faust]], [[Baira]], [[Dr. Genome]], [[Emma Bessho|Ghost Gal]], [[George Gore|The Gore]] and [[Kenneth Drayden|The Shepherd]]. Roboppi noted [[Yusaku Fujiki|Playmaker's]] absence and asked if he wasn't coming, but Ai reassured Roboppi that nothing could start without Playmaker and he was proven right as Playmaker arrived. He and Roboppi left Linguriboh and boarded their [[Duel Board]]s as Ai suggested they defeat everyone.<ref name=\"ep105\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|105|ref}}</ref> As they approached Central Station, Ai noted that it would be difficult to reach Zaizen and wondered if it had been [[Cal Kolter|Kolter's]] doing, while Roboppi was concerned they were outnumbered by their twelve opponents. Ai admitted that Roboppi was the lowest-rated Duelist among them, as he had never Dueled before, but suggested Roboppi raise his rating by gaining experience points from defeating strong opponents. To even the odds and allow him to avoid Dueling the strongest opponents first, Ai created three copies to engage Playmaker, Varis and Soulburner, while he and Roboppi slipped past them to the next line of defenders. While Ai engaged the Knights of Hanoi, Roboppi searched for other opponents before Ai could defeat them all. He was then attacked by The Shepherd using his artificial arm, accompanied by Ghost Gal and a mysterious Duel AI that introduced itself as [[Pandor]], an anti-Ignis AI. Roboppi stated that he wanted to Duel The Shepherd and Ghost Gal simultaneously even though he wasn't an [[Ignis]].<ref name=\"ep106\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|106|ref}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Speed Duel]] began, Roboppi stated he wouldn't use his Skill, though he stated that his opponents could use theirs freely and claimed he weren't looking down on them, but just trying to have a difficult Duel. Shepherd quickly [[Link Summon]]ed his [[Signature card|ace monster]], \"[[Battledrone General]]\", and Roboppi Link Summoned \"[[Appliancer Celtopus (anime)|Appliancer Celtopus]]\" and [[co-link]]ed \"[[Appliancer Vacculephant (anime)|Appliancer Vacculephant]]\" and \"[[Appliancer Propelion (anime)|Appliancer Propelion]]\" to it to oppose Shepherd, though Shepherd blunted his efforts by protecting his \"[[Drone]]s\" with \"[[Camouflage Drone]]\" and his \"[[Drone Force]]\" Skill to minimize the damage they took. Roboppi then told them about how he had become smarter and decided that humans were the worst creatures on Earth, voicing his desire to turn humans into experience points and clean the Earth. On Ghost Gal's [[turn]], she made the most of Shepherd's [[monster]]s in combination with her own \"[[Altergeist]]\" cards to Link Summon \"[[Altergeist Hexstia (anime)|Altergeist Hexstia]]\" and \"[[Altergeist Memorygant (anime)|Altergeist Memorygant]]\", and increase the [[ATK]] of \"Hexstia\" to 4300, much to Roboppi's shock. Ghost Gal explained to Roboppi that this was the bond she shared with her brother, vowing to defeat him with \"Memorygant\".<ref name=\"ep106\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|106|ref}}</ref> Ghost Gal successfully inflicted direct damage to Roboppi with Shepherd's \"Drones\", but was less successful when [[attack]]ing with \"Hexstia\", as the effect of \"Propelion\" halved its ATK and destroyed it. Ghost Gal Tributed \"General\" to increase the ATK of \"Memorygant\" and reduced Roboppi to 200 [[LP]], [[destroy]]ing Roboppi's co-linked monsters and putting herself in a position to win, but Roboppi was able to protect \"Celtopus\" and his LP. As he celebrated surviving the turn, Pandor pointed out that he had no cards in his hand. Despite the disadvantage, Roboppi believed in his next draw and drew \"[[Appliancer Test (anime)|Appliancer Test]]\" to revive \"Propelion\" and \"Vacculephant\", using \"Propelion\" to Link Summon \"[[Appliancer Laundry Dragon (anime)|Appliancer Laundry Dragon]]\". Ghost Gal was able to blunt both of the effects of Roboppi's monsters, but Roboppi rearranged his monsters to unlock their other effects, allowing \"Vacculephant\" to attack directly. Ghost Gal used \"[[Secret Cure]]\" to restore their LP, but the value was too low to prevent the effect of \"Laundry Dragon\" from wiping her out. As the attack approached, The Shepherd threw himself in the way to absorb the impact, thanking Ghost Gal for freeing him from his prison of hate, and Ghost Gal reached for her brother's hand as their data was absorbed by Ai. Roboppi admitted that he didn't understand what had happened, but he knew it was good, and he hurried off to inform Ai of these new feelings.<ref name=\"ep107\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|107|ref}}</ref>\n\nRoboppi and Ai arrived at Central Station, but to Roboppi's surprise the Zaizens weren't there and Ai explained they were broadcasting from a location he would have to physically attack to reach them.<ref name=\"ep108\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|108|ref}}</ref> Roboppi was able to make his way to the Zaizens' location where he found Ai Dueling them both with Playmaker, Soulburner and Varis watching and he vowed to learn from the Duel. After Ai gained a quick lead over Blue Maiden, she asked him to stop the Duel, trying to appeal to their shared loss, but Ai refused and Blue Maiden's copy of Pandor accused Ai of trying to garner everyone's sympathy for an easier Duel. Roboppi commented Pandor shouldn't have said that and Ai reassured Roboppi all he had to do was win, prompting Roboppi to make a meat-based pun that impressed Ai.<ref name=\"ep110\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|110|ref}}</ref> Zaizen Summoned \"[[Tindangle Hound (anime)|Tindangle Hound]]\" and \"[[Tindangle Acute Cerberus (anime)|Tindangle Acute Cerberus]]\", attacking with \"Acute Cerberus\" despite its lower ATK, much to Roboppi's confusion, though Ai noted Zaizen was up to something and was proven right when Zaizen used the effect of Blue Maiden's \"[[Marincess Decision]]\" from his [[Graveyard]] to reduce the ATK of Ai's \"[[Fire Phoenix @Ignister (anime)|Fire Phoenix @Ignister]]\" to zero and drop Ai to 400 LP. Ai counterattacked on his next turn, Roboppi having to count the math of the effect of \"[[Water Leviathan @Ignister (anime)|Water Leviathan @Ignister]]\" on his fingers but being impressed by the strength of the effect. Blue Maiden in turn began to push Ai into a corner with her \"[[Marincess Great Bubble Reef (anime)|Marincess Great Bubble Reef]]\" and \"[[Marincess Bubble Circle]]\" combo and Roboppi vowed to get revenge for Ai if he lost. Fortunately Ai was able to inflict enough effect damage to Blue Maiden to win the Duel, and he claimed Zaizen's data and code key, but spared Blue Maiden and Pandor. Roboppi noted Ai was being uncharacteristically compassionate, but Ai claimed he was sparing Blue Maiden so she would know how he felt before departing with Roboppi.<ref name=\"ep111\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|111|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter Ai took control of SOL Technologies and reopened LINK VRAINS, Roboppi dreamt for the first time aboard Linguriboh, dreaming he was melting into the universe. He told Ai about the dream when he awoke, and Ai declared it meant something and assumed the garb of a fortune-teller, suggesting Roboppi would eventually become a stronger and smarter conqueror than Ai himself and that Roboppi would have to start small. He gave Roboppi a kingdom in LINK VRAINS, though Roboppi was concerned he would have to Duel Playmaker. Ai reassured Roboppi that as a conqueror he would have to defend his kingdom and gave him some data before dropping Roboppi out of Linguriboh and onto his Duel Board. Roboppi immediately went to LINK VRAINS and found his new kingdom populated by appliances, encouraging them to come out by briefly transforming into his robot form. As they celebrated, the appliances went into hiding and Soulburner arrived looking for Ai. Roboppi told Soulburner to leave as he wasn't an appliance, refusing to divulge Ai's location unless Soulburner could defeat him in a Duel.<ref name=\"ep112\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|112|ref}}</ref>\n\nRoboppi started strongly, Summoning \"Appliancer Celtopus\" and co-linking it with \"Vaccuelephant\" and \"Propelion\".<ref name=\"ep112\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|112|ref}}</ref> Playmaker arrived as well, and Roboppi greeted his former master and told him to leave, again insisting he wouldn't betray Ai. Soulburner mounted a strong offensive against Roboppi, [[equip]]ping \"[[Salamangreat Heatleo (anime)|Salamangreat Heatleo]]\" with \"[[Salamangreat Claw (anime)|Salamangreat Claw]]\" and \"[[Salamangreat Fang (anime)|Salamangreat Fang]]\" to allow \"Heatleo\" to attack three times and damage Roboppi further when it destroyed his monsters, reducing Roboppi to 1000 LP after Soulburner destroyed \"Vaccuelephant\" and \"Propelion\". Soulburner told Roboppi he didn't mind stopping the Duel but Roboppi refused, accusing Soulburner of making Ai suffer due to his failure to protect Flame and refusing to accept Ai knew Flame couldn't be saved. He Link Summoned \"Laundry Dragon\" and used both of its effects to banish and destroy \"Heatleo\" multiple times while banishing the \"Salamangreat Balelynx\" from Soulburner's Graveyard to prevent him using its second effect, depleting most of Soulburner's LP and celebrating being able to beat him despite his strength.<ref name=\"ep113\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|113|ref}}</ref> Despite Roboppi's card advantage, Soulburner revived and reincarnated \"Heatleo\" again on his next turn, also retrieving \"Salamangreat Claw\" to allow \"Heatleo\" to attack three times, but Roboppi revealed the third effect of \"[[Appliancer Electrilyrical World (anime)|Appliancer Electrilyrical World]]\", which he had kept secret to surprise Soulburner, and moved \"Laundry Dragon\" back into position to gain ATK and banish \"Heatleo\" with its ability, mocking Soulburner's lack of ability. To Roboppi's shock, Soulburner used the effect of his \"[[Salamangreat Zebroid X (anime)|Salamangreat Zebroid X]]\" to [[Xyz Summon]] \"[[Salamangreat Blaze Dragon (anime)|Salamangreat Blaze Dragon]]\" during the Battle Phase and powered it up enough to defeat Roboppi, who barely survived by halving the damage with \"[[Appliancer Reduction]]\".<ref name=\"ep114\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|114|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe damage triggered something in Roboppi, enhancing his intelligence even further to the point his programming couldn't handle it. In the dub, he was also triggered by the shock that Soulburner had actually tried to destroy him. Roboppi went wild, declaring him was stronger than Ai and relentlessly attacking Soulburner with the effects and attacks of \"Vaccuelephant\" and \"Laundry Dragon\". Soulburner defended himself with the effect of \"Blaze Dragon\" in response, even [[Xyz Evolution#Reincarnation Xyz Summon|Reincarnation Xyz Summoning]] another copy and trying to destroy \"Laundry Dragon\", though Roboppi once again saved his monster and banished Soulburner's other \"Balelynx\" from his Graveyard to prevent him using it. Eventually Roboppi exhausted all of Soulburner's defenses and prepared to attack one final time, but his inability to handle his emotions had finally taken their toll and he began to malfunction, ending his turn without attacking. In the dub, Roboppi's true personality decided he didn't want to hurt his friends and ended the turn. Roboppi then returned to his robot form, struggling to move and stating it needed to clean Yusaku's room, and Playmaker asked Soulburner to finish the Duel and end Roboppi. Roboppi remained blissfully unaware of their final fate as the attack of \"Salamangreat Heatleo\" approached it, though in the dub he regained just enough sanity to wish Playmaker and Soulburner luck, and Roboppi was destroyed by the attack.<ref name=\"ep114\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|114|ref}}</ref>\n\nAfter Yusaku returned to his apartment he looked at Roboppi's empty shell one last time before leaving to confront Ai. Ai confirmed he knew Roboppi would eventually break down and revealed he had been responsible for Roboppi's dream, which he had hoped would be one Roboppi would enjoy.<ref name=\"ep117\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS|117|ref}}</ref>\n\n==Deck==\nRoboppi uses an '''\"[[Appliancer]]\" Deck''', the focus of which is to [[Co-linked|co-link]] \"[[Appliancer Celtopus]]\" with Link-1 \"Appliancer\" [[Link Monster]]s to increase their [[ATK]], as well as to use the co-link [[Monster effect|effects]] of said Link-1 [[Link Monster]]s.

They initially feared that he may snatch their souls, like he did with Solomon Muto at the beginning of the series, but this time it's a regular video recording. In it, Pegasus said that he had found the reasons behind the recent monster attacks and pleads of Yugi to go to the USA in a private jet.\n*[[Yugi]], [[Joey]], and the gang arrive at [[Industrial Illusions]], and the doors lock behind them. The gang is confronted by [[Mai Valentine]]. She reveals that she has joined Doma because of her loneliness and overwhelming drive to become the best Duelist. She reflects on her first assignment -- challenging Pegasus. Even the creator of Duel Monsters was not able to beat her, and although his soul is taken, she wants to prove her power elsewhere. Joey wants to free her from this influence, but he's the one that Mai wants to Duel first. He refuses, but she starts anyway and activates \"[[The Seal of Orichalcos]]\", trapping him and determining that one of them will lose their soul. Even as she ends her first Turn, he still does not want to duel her, and he is at the brink of despair. Nothing he says is getting through to her, and fighting back would only mean that her soul could be captured.\n** Later in the duel, Mai recalls having fought in Duel Monsters tournaments and won, but the victories were not really meaningful. When she was alone, she still remembered the fear from her Punishment Game, and she knew there was still the chance of such a loss.\n**In such anxiety, she met Valon, who offered a way for her to find power which would mean she could never be defeated. He introduces her to Dartz (this is the first time he announces his own name), who convinces her that her only solution is to keep on winning. He grants her the power of the Orichalcos.\n**Valon is watching Mai duel Joey now, as is Rafael, though Valon is far more interested in Mai's progress.\n\n===The 3rd Dragon===\n* Backed into such a corner, he notices a bright light coming from his Deck. He is transported to another world, arriving at a crystal statue of a dragon with a sword stuck in it. He removes the sword, freeing \"[[The Claw of Hermos]]\" and bonding to it.[[File:Yugioh154.jpg|thumb]] In the real world again, he takes his Turn, Drawing and revealing Hermos, the newest power of his Deck.\n* Rafael's Orichalcos fragments shines and he realizes it must be the \"Legendary Dragon\", making Valon nervous.\nJoey unlocked and Drew \"Claw of Hermos\", surprising everyone.\n*His Field is empty, but he plays the last three Cards in his Hand to help him turn the Duel around.\nFirst, he revives his strongest Monster so far and he then adds his trusty \"Time Wizard\" to the field.\nJoey then brings out \"Hermos\" and then combines \"Time Wizard\" with the power of Hermos.\nTo his bewilderment, the result is a golden cartoonish hammer with tiny wings.\nValon laughs at such a ridiculous thing being used as a weapon, but Yami, Yugi and Rafael know there is more to it.\nJoey decides to put his trust in this Card anyway. He equips it to his Warrior and Attacks.\n*Mai decides to play it safe, using a parrying Trap. The hammer activates its magic anyway, opening a hole in the group which places a magical orb atop each of Mai's monsters and each orb turns into a number.\nNothing else happens. Joey has no choice left but to end his turn.\nMai takes her turn, intending to end this once and for all, but all at once, her Monsters are all sucked into the hole opened by the hammer. Neither she nor Joey knows how that happened, nor does Yami, but he notes that the hole is still there.\nJoey seizes the opportunity for a Direct Attack, cutting Mai's lead significantly. As she gets back to her feet from the impact, she is shuddering to think that she is once again in danger of losing. Joey is determined to end the duel in a Draw so that neither him nor Mai will lose their soul.\n*When she starts her next turn, Harpie's Pet Dragon returns to her field. This enables Yami and Yugi to realize the true power of Time Magic Hammer: it doesn't Destroy Monsters, but rather, it sends them into the 'future' a random number of Turns. Since the Pet Dragon had a 1 on it, Mai has it back 1 Turn after it was removed.\nMai seizes onto the advantage in attack power right away, attacking even as Rafael mutters how she's losing her composure. Valon yells out in protest. But it's too late: Joey triggers the Trap he took the chance to set on his previous Turn. Harpie's Pet Dragon is Destroyed, and Mai's Life Points are reduced very near to Joey's. To her, it only means she is very near to losing.\n\n==Valon's Interuption==\n\n*Rafael gives up on her, but without another word, Valon leaps from the balcony from which he has been looking down. He uses the Orichalcos stone on his ring to break through the barrier projected by the Seal.\n*The magical barrier explodes, and when the smoke clears, both Duelists are unconscious.\n*As Valon clutches Mai to him and pays no heed to Rafael's scolding. Rafael tells Yami he'll be going after him next. He raises his own stone, projecting a light which makes everybody shield their eyes. When they look again, the three are gone.\n\n\n==Featured Duel: Joey Wheeler Vs Mai Valentine==\n\n<u>'''Turn 1: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws \"[[The Seal of Orichalcos]]\" and subsequently activates it. From now on, all of Mai's Monsters will receive a +500 [[ATK]] boost and the loser of this Duel will lose his/her soul. Mai then Normal Summons \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" (1300 → 1800/1400) in [[Attack Position]]. \n\n<u>'''Turn 2: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey draws \"[[Alligator's Sword]]\" and subsequently Normal Summons it (1500/1200) in [[Defense Position]].\n\n<u>'''Turn 3: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws another \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" and subsequently Normal Summons it (1300 → 1800/1400) in Attack Position. The newly summoned \"Harpie Lady\" attacks & destroys Joey's \"[[Alligator's Sword]]\". The other \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" attacks Joey directly ([[Joey]] 4000 → 2200). Mai Sets a Card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 4: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey draws \"Scapegoat\". He then Normal Summons \"[[Rocket Warrior]]\" (1500/1300) in [[Defense Position]] and Sets a Card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 5: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws. One \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" attacks & destroys Joey's \"[[Rocket Warrior]]\". The other \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" attacks Joey directly, but Joey activates \"[[Scapegoat]]\" to [[Special Summon]] 4 \"[[Sheep Token]]s\" (0/0 For all) in Defense Position. Mai then activates \"[[Nighmare Tri-Mirror]]\" to target one of her \"Harpie Ladies\" and [[Special Summon]]s 4 Copy Tokens with the same stats as \"Harpie Lady\" in Attack Position (1300 → 1800/1400 for all four tokens). These monsters cannot attack this turn. Mai then places them in her [[Spell & Trap Card Zone]]s. A replay occurs and Mai uses her second \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" to attack & destroy one \"[[Sheep Token]]\". Mai Sets a Card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 6: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey draws \"[[Panther Warrior]]\" and subsequently Normal Summons it (2000/1600) in [[Attack Position]]. He then [[Tribute]]s 1 \"[[Sheep Token]]\" so that \"[[Panther Warrior]]\" can attack. \"Panther Warrior\" attacks one of Mai's \"Harpie Ladies\", but Mai activates \"[[Harpie Lady Sparrow Formation]]\" to negate the Attack.\n\n<u>'''Turn 7: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws \"[[Harpie Lady Phoenix Formation]]\" and subsequently activates it to destroy Joey's \"[[Panther Warrior]]\" and two \"[[Sheep Token]]s\" and inflict their total [[ATK]] to Joey as damage ([[Joey]] 2200 → 200), however no Harpie monsters can attack this turn. Joey is about to surrender the Duel to save Mai, but [[Yami Yugi]] convinces him not to.\n\n<u>'''Turn 8: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey draws.Joey's hand contains \"Compensation Mediation\", \"Monster Reborn\", \"Time Wizard\", \"Drop Off\", and \"The Fiend Megacyber\". Since Mai has at least 2 more Monsters than him in play, Joey Special Summons \"[[The Fiend Megacyber]]\" (2200/1200) in Attack Position. \"[[The Fiend Megacyber]]\" attacks & destroys one \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" ([[Mai Valentine|Mai]] 4000 → 3600). Joey Sets a Card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 9: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws. She then [[Tribute]]s two of her four tokens to Summon \"[[Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\" (2000 → 2500/2500) in Attack Position. Due to the effect of \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\", it gains 300 ATK for each \"Harpie Lady\" on the field. Since there are three \"[[Harpie Lady|Harpie Ladies]]\" on the field, \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\" gains 900 [[ATK]] (\"[[Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\": 2500 → 3400/2500). \n\n\"Harpie's Pet Dragon\" attacks \"[[The Fiend Megacyber]]\", but Joey activates \"[[Compensation Mediation]]\" to force Mai to picks two Cards from her [[Graveyard]] and put them along with \"[[Compensation Mediation]]\" face-Down on the Field. Joey then picks one Card. It is revealed to be \"[[Compensation Mediation]]\". Because of this, Mai's Battle Phase immediately ends and she returns her two chosen Cards (\"[[Harpie Lady Phoenix Formation]]\" and \"[[Harpie Lady Sparrow Formation]]\") back to the top of her Deck in the order she chooses. Mai then moves her \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" to the [[Spell & Trap Card Zone]] and Sets two Cards.\n\n<u>'''Turn 10: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey draws. He then Sets a Card and a Monster. Joey then switches \"[[The Fiend Megacyber]]\" to [[Defense Position]].\n\n<u>'''Turn 11: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws \"Harpie Lady Sparrow Formation\". Joey then activates \"[[Drop Off]]\" to make Mai discard the card she just drew, but Mai activates \"[[Trap Jammer]]\" to negate the effect of \"Drop Off\" and destroy it. Mai then Sets a Card. \"[[Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\" attacks & destroys Joey's \"[[The Fiend Megacyber]]\". \"[[Harpie Lady]]\" attacks & destroys Joey's Face-Down Monster. It's revealed to be \"[[Fiber Jar]]\" (500/500). Since \"Fiber Jar\" was flipped face-up, its Flip Effect activates, which would add all the cards in both players' Graveyards to their Decks and force both players draw five cards, but Mai activates \"[[Harpie's Feather Storm (anime)|Harpie's Feather Storm]]\" to negate the Flip Effect of \"Fiber Jar\" and end the Battle Phase.\n\n<u>'''Turn 12: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey draws a Monster and subsequently sets it.\n\n<u>'''Turn 13: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws \"[[Harpie Lady Phoenix Formation]]\" and subsequently activates it to destroy Joey's face-down monster and inflict its total ATK as damage to Joey. The set monster is revealed to be \"[[Neko Mane King]]\" (0/0). Since it has 0 ATK, Joey takes no damage from the effect of \"Harpie Lady Phoenix Formation\". Since \"Neko Mane King\" was destroyed by a card effect, its effect activates, ending Mai's turn immediately.\n\n<u>'''Turn 14: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey & Yami have a vision, and Joey unlocks the \"[[Claw of Hermos]]\". It is the Card he draws during his [[Draw Phase]]. He then activates \"[[Monster Reborn]]\" to [[Special Summon]] \"[[The Fiend Megacyber]]\" (2200/1200) from his Graveyard in Attack Position. Joey then [[Normal Summon]]s \"[[Time Wizard]]\" (500/400) in Attack Position. He then activates \"[[Claw of Hermos]]\" to send the latter and \"Time Wizard\" to the Graveyard and activate \"[[Time Magic Hammer]]\". Joey equips \"Time Magic Hammer\" to \"The Fiend Megacyber\". \"The Fiend Megacyber\" attacks \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\", but Mai activates \"[[Harpie Lady Sparrow Formation]]\" to negate the attack. The effect of \"Time Magic Hammer\" then activates, giving a random number from 1-6 to each of Mai's monsters: 1 to \"[[Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\" and 3, 2, and 6 for the three \"[[Harpie Lady|Harpie Ladies]]\".\n\n<u>'''Turn 15: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws. On Mai's Standby Phase, all of Mai's monsters are removed from play. During each of Mai's Standby Phase, a monster that \"Time Magic Hammer\" removed from play will be returned to the field if its number corresponds to the number of Mai's turns that have passed since Joey activated the effect of \"Time Magic Hammer\". Mai then Sets 1 Card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 16: Joey'''</u><br />\nJoey draws. \"The Fiend Megacyber\" attacks Mai directly (Mai 3600 → 1400). Joey Sets one Card.\n\n<u>'''Turn 17: Mai'''</u><br />\nMai draws. On Mai's Standby Phase, the effect of \"Time Magic Hammer\" returns \"[[Harpie's Pet Dragon]]\" to the fField in the same Battle Position it was in prior to it being removed from play (2000/2500). \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\" then gains 500 ATK due to the effect of \"[[The Seal of Orichalcos]]\" (\"Harpie's Pet Dragon\": 2000 → 2500/2500). \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\" attacks \"The Fiend Megacyber\", but Joey activates \"[[Skull Dice]]\" to roll a die and divide the ATK of \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\" by the result. Joey get a two, so the ATK of \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\" is halved (\"Harpie's Pet Dragon\": 2500 → 1250/2500). \"The Fiend Megacyber\" destroys \"Harpie's Pet Dragon\" (Mai 1400 → 450). \n\nAt this point, [[Valon]] uses a fragment of Orichalcos on his ring to unlock \"[[The Seal of Orichalcos]]\" as he can't bear to see Mai lose her soul. This causes the Duel to end with no result. Mai had one face-down card and a card in her hand, though since she didn't use her face-down to prevent Joey's last attack, it's likely it wouldn't have helped her. Therefore, the result of the duel had Valon not have interrupted is impossible to determine.\n\n==Featured Cards==\nThe following cards appeared in this duel.

Each monster has the \"Centurion\" katakana applied over its individual kanji name, which denotes its \"rank\" within the theme.\n\n==Design==\n<div style=\"float:right\">[[File:Crest-Centurion.png|thumb|left|100px|The \"Centur-Ion\" crest.]]</div>\nThe archetype's design seems to be inspired from various examples of mecha in media, such as anime produced by [[wikipedia:Gainax|Gainax]] and its successor [[wikipedia:Studio Trigger|Studio Trigger]]. In particular ''[[wikipedia:Gunbuster|Gunbuster]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]]'', and ''[[wikipedia:Darling in the Franxx|Darling in the Franxx]]''. It also seems to reference SD Mecha series, particularly Haō Taikei Ryū Knight, as well as the [[wikipedia:Sakura Wars|Sakura Wars]] series of games.\n\n===Members===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | Centur-Ion\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | Team\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Combined<br/>[[Synchro Monster|Synchro]]\n|-\n!

Squire\n|-\n| [[Centur-Ion Gargoyle II|Gargoyle II]]\n| -\n| -\n| [[Centur-Ion Auxila|Auxila]]\n|-\n| [[Centur-Ion Emeth VI|Emeth VI]]\n| [[Centur-Ion Primera|Primera]]\n| [[Centur-Ion Trudea|Trudea]]\n| [[Centur-Ion Legatia|Legatia]]\n|}\n\n==Playing style==\n\"Centur-Ion\" is a [[Synchro]] theme focused on placing monsters in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]] as [[Continuous Trap Card]]s and quickly [[Synchro Summon]]ing various [[Level]] 8 and 12 [[Synchro Monster]]s, including their Level 12 Synchro Monster, \"[[Centur-Ion Legatia]]\".\n\nAll [[Main Deck]] monsters can [[Special Summon]] themselves while in the [[Spell & Trap Zone]]. Since their effects treat them as Continuous Traps, they can also Summon themselves during the opponent's turn. Combined with \"[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]\", the archetype's [[Field Spell]], they can perform Synchro Summons to interrupt the opponent's plays during their own turn.\n\n\"Stand Up Centur-Ion!\", \"[[Centur-Ion Primera]]\", and \"[[Centur-Ion Trudea]]\" function as the Deck's starters. \"Stand-Up!\" and \"Trudea\" can place a \"Centur-Ion\" monster from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone, while \"Primera\" can search any \"Centur-Ion\" card when it is Summoned. \"Primera\", by using its effect to Special Summon itself while it is a Continuous Trap, can repeatedly add \"Centur-Ion\" cards to the hand, even during the opponent's turn.\n\nBy placing \"Centur-Ion\" monsters as Continuous Traps, the Deck can consistently generate materials to perform Synchro Summons. This is further aided by \"[[Centur-Ion Emeth VI]]\", a Level 8 monster that can Special Summon itself (during the opponent's turn) from the hand or GY by placing another \"Centur-Ion\" monster the player controls in the Spell & Trap Zone. \"Trudea\" can also be used as material, since it can increase its Level to 8 when it is Special Summoned while treated as a Continuous Trap.\n\nThe Deck's ability to consistently Summon \"Primera\", a Level 4 Tuner, and Level 8 monsters, results in an efficient gameplay loop of Synchro Summoning multiple Level 12 Synchro Monsters. Among them, the two most notable ones are the archetype's boss monster, \"Centur-Ion Legatia\", and \"[[Crimson Dragon (card)|Crimson Dragon]]\". \"Legatia\" can produce advantage by drawing a card and (optionally) [[destroy]]ing the opponent's monsters with the highest [[ATK]] when it is Special Summoned, and can also place \"Centur-Ion\" monsters from the hand or GY back in the Spell & Trap Zone, enabling more Synchro Summons. \"Crimson Dragon\" works as a bridge to even more powerful Level 12 [[Dragon]] Synchro Monsters, since it can Summon them while bypassing their material requirements, all while simply requiring the player to control another Level 12 Synchro Monster.\n\n\"[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]\" is a particularly powerful card to Summon with this archetype, as it can prevent the opponent from activating effects for the remainder of the turn when it is Synchro Summoned. Combined with \"Stand Up Centur-Ion!\", it can shut down the opponent's turn as early as during their Main Phase 1, a process which requires only \"Stand Up Centur-Ion!\" (as detailed [[#Sample combos|below]]).\n\nThe archetype also has multiple Spells/Traps that work as extenders or as removal, all of which can be consistently and repeatedly searched by \"Primera\". \"[[Centur-Ion True Awakening]]\" can negate the activation of a card effect by sending a monster from the Spell & Trap Zone to the GY, which is easily achieved by other \"Centur-Ion\" cards. \"[[Centur-Ion Bonds]]\" can place any \"Centur-Ion\" monster from the hand or GY in the Spell & Trap Zone, and it can do it once more with its GY effect when the player Summons a \"Centur-Ion\" Synchro Monster. \"[[Centur-Ion Phalanx]]\" can [[banish]] a [[Monster Card]] on the field, and Summon it back to its owner's field during the [[Standby Phase]] of the next turn, which can be used to disrupt the opponent's plays, or to Summon a \"Centur-Ion\" Monster Card from the player's Spell & Trap Zone.\n\n===Sample combos===\nOne of the Deck's most important plays is a 1.5-card combo to Summon \"[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]\" during the opponent's turn, which can shut down nearly all of their plays.\n{{Combo steps\n| opening = \"[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]\" + 1 card\n| end     = \"[[Centur-Ion Legatia]]\" + 1 draw + \"[[Centur-Ion Trudea]]\" in S/T Zone + (during opponent's turn) \"[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]\"\n| steps   = \n# Activate \"[[Stand Up Centur-Ion!]]\" by sending 1 card the GY to place \"[[Centur-Ion Primera]]\" from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone\n# Activate \"Primera\" to Summon itself and add \"[[Centur-Ion Trudea]]\" to the hand\n# Normal Summon \"Trudea\"\n# Activate \"Trudea\" to place itself and \"[[Centur-Ion Emeth VI]]\" from the Deck in the Spell & Trap Zone\n# Activate \"Emet VI\" to Summon itself\n# Synchro Summon \"[[Centur-Ion Legatia]]\" by using \"Primera\" and \"Emet VI\"\n# Activate \"Legatia\" to draw 1 card\n# During the End Phase, activate \"Legatia\" to place \"Primera\" from the GY in the Spell & Trap Zone\n# During the opponent's Main Phase 1, activate \"Trudea\" and \"Primera\" to Summon themselves from the Spell & Trap Zone\n# Activate \"Emet VI\" to Summon itself from the GY by placing \"Trudea\" in the Spell & Trap Zone\n# Activate \"Stand Up Centur-Ion!\" to Synchro Summon \"[[Crimson Dragon (card)|Crimson Dragon]]\" by using \"Primera\" and \"Emet VI\"\n# Activate \"Crimson Dragon\" by targeting Legatia to return itself to the Extra Deck and Summon \"[[Hot Red Dragon Archfiend King Calamity]]\" from the Extra Deck\n# Activate \"King Calamity\"\n}}\n\n===Recommended cards===\n{{Decklist|Recommended cards\n<!--This is not an exact Decklist.
