R]]''. \n\n==Design==\n===Appearance===\nDixon is an older man with white hair and small glasses. He wear military-style fatigues, leather boots, and a close-fitting cap. He carries a KaibaCorp Duel Disk on his left arm.\n\n===Personality===\nDixon is a pragmatist, separating Yugi from his friends in order to weaken him and cruelly taunting Yugi about them in an attempt to cloud his judgment. Due to his confidence in his own strength, he reacts with utter disbelief at his loss.\n\n===Etymology===\nHe is named after Dixon, a pre-release codename for the 333&nbsp;MHz 1.6V Intel Pentium II chip. \n\n==Biography==\nDixon was one of the thirteen [[Card Professor]] mercenaries hired by [[Yako Tenma]] for [[Project R.A.]].\n\n[[Katsuya Jonouchi (manga)|Katsuya Jonouchi]] accidentally triggered a trap, which separated himself and [[Hiroto Honda (manga)|Hiroto Honda]] from [[Dark Yugi (manga)|Dark Yugi]], shortly before Dixon appeared. Dixon explained that for reasons beyond the understanding of the Card Professors, Yugi was stronger when his friends were around him, so the trap had been necessary to exclude such factors. He mocked Jonouchi and Honda for falling for the first trap and when Dark Yugi asked him where Jonouchi and Honda were, he said he didn't know but guessed they were where he thought they belonged, in the garbage room. Enraged, Dark Yugi accepted [[Dark Yugi and Kirk Dixon's Duel|the Duel]] to make Dixon pay for his remarks.<ref name=\"r 6\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! R|6|ref}}</ref>\n\nDixon quickly brought out \"[[Machina Soldier (manga)|Machine Soldier]]\", \"[[Machina Defender (manga)|Machine Defender]]\" and \"[[Machina Sniper (manga)|Machine Blaster]]\" and used \"[[Commander Covington (manga)|Commander Covington]]\" to merge them into \"[[Machina Force (manga)|Machine Force]]\". However, Dark Yugi used \"[[Spellbinding Illusion]]\" to [[negate]] the effect of \"Commander Covington\", splitting \"Machine Force\" back into its three components and used \"[[Dark Magician Girl (manga)|Dark Magician Girl]]\" and \"[[Diffusion Wave-Motion (manga)|Diffusion Wave-Motion]]\" to attack all of Dixon's monsters and drop his [[Life Points]] to 0.<ref name=\"r 6\" />\n\nShocked by his defeat, Dixon dropped a number of cards, including a card key, Dark Yugi needed to access the next part of the building. He then stumbled onto a trap which catapulted him into a trash receptacle. Jonouchi and Honda then spotted him on a lower floor as he fell through a chute and into a skip.<ref name=\"r 6\" /> After Yugi defeated Yako, Dixon accompanied [[Klamath Osler]] as he returned the boys' bags, grudgingly saluting them.<ref name=\"r 44\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh! R|44|ref}}</ref>\n\n==Deck==\nKirk uses a \"[[Machina]]\" [[Deck]]. In the English manga, the word \"Machina\" is replaced with \"Machine\".\n\n{{Manga card list |\n* Caterpillar Tank \n* Commander Covington (manga)\n* Machina Defender (manga)\n* Machina Sniper (manga)\n* Machina Soldier (manga)\n* Machina Force (manga)\n* Ties of the Brethren (manga)\n* Intruder Alarm - Yellow Alert (manga)\n}}\n\n==Duels==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!\n!

R]]''.\n\n==Events==\n===Prior events===\nTilla was one of thirteen [[Card Professor]] mercenaries hired by [[Yako Tenma]] for [[Project R.A.]] She was set up as Yugi's second opponent at KaibaCorp and was offered a cash reward if she could defeat him.\n\nUsing [[Solid Vision]], she created a desolate yard with Gothic-style fencing and withered trees, which she deemed an appropriate Duel field for her master, \"[[Vampire's Curse]]\".\n\nWhen Dark Yugi, [[Katsuya Jonouchi (manga)|Jonouchi]] and [[Hiroto Honda (manga)|Honda]] arrived Tilla told them that there was bounty of $100,000 (US) for defeating the Yugis. She wagered the card key that Dark Yugi needed to enter the next block of the building for the \"[[Soul Prison]]\" containing [[Anzu Mazaki (manga)|Anzu]]'s soul, which she would need as proof she defeated Yugi to claim the prize money.\n\n===The Duel===\n;Tilla's turn\nTilla [[Summon]]ed \"[[Blood Sucker]]\" ([[ATK]]: 1300) and [[Set]] \"[[Blood Curse]]\".\n\n;Dark Yugi's turn\nDark Yugi Summoned \"[[Beta The Magnet Warrior|Beta the Magnet Warrior]]\" (ATK: 1700).\n\n\"Beta the Magnet Warrior\" [[attack]]ed and [[destroy]]ed \"Blood Sucker\" (Tilla: 4000 → 3600 [[Life Points]]).\n\nTilla [[activate]]d \"[[Blood Curse]]\", [[Special Summon]]ing \"[[Vampire Lady]]\" from her [[Main Deck|Deck]].\n\nDark Yugi Set \"[[Soul Rope]]\" and \"[[Bounce Spell]]\".\n\n;Tilla's turn\nTilla [[Tribute]]d \"Vampire Lady\" to Summon \"[[Vampire's Curse]]\" (ATK: 2000)\n\n\"Vampire's Curse\" attacked and destroyed \"Beta the Magnet Warrior\" (Dark Yugi: 4000 → 3700 Life Points).\n\nDark Yugi activated \"[[Soul Rope]]\", [[Cost|paying]] 1000 Life Points (Dark Yugi: 3700 → 2700) to Special Summon \"[[Gamma The Magnet Warrior|Gamma the Magnet Warrior]]\" (ATK: 1500).\n\n;Dark Yugi's turn\nDark Yugi Summoned \"[[Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts]]\" and activated \"[[Union Attack]]\" combining the ATK of his two monsters (ATK: 1500 → 3000).\n\nDark Yugi's monsters attacked and destroyed \"Vampire's Curse\" (Tilla: 3600 → 2600 Life Points).\n\n;Tilla's turn\n[[File:R-004 Bite.jpg|thumb|left|\"[[Vampire's Curse]]\" sucks Tilla's blood as she pays its [[cost]].]]\nTilla resurrected \"Vampire's Curse\" through its effect (ATK: 2000 → 2500, Tilla: 2600 → 1600 Life Points). As Tilla paid the Life Point cost, \"Vampire's Curse\" bit her in the neck and became stronger by sucking her blood.\n\nTilla activated \"[[Overpowering Eye|Evil Eye of Coercion]]\", giving \"Vampire's Curse\" the ability to attack [[Direct attack|directly]]. This caused Dark Yugi's monsters to bow, before \"Vampire's Curse\", allowing him to pass them and attack Dark Yugi (Dark Yugi: 2700 → 200 Life Points).\n\n;Dark Yugi's turn\nDark Yugi Tributed \"Gamma the Magnet Warrior\" and \"Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts\" to Summon \"[[Buster Blader]]\".\n\nDark Yugi used \"[[Bounce Spell]]\" to take control of \"Evil Eye of Coercion\", allowing \"Buster Blader\" to attack Tilla directly (Tilla: 1600 → 0 Life Points).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nDark Yugi won the card key, gaining access to the next part of the building. Tilla also gave her [[Duel Disk]] to Jonouchi, who asked if he could borrow it.\n\n==Cards used==\n{{Decklist|Dark Yugi\n|monsters =\n* [[Beta The Magnet Warrior|Beta the Magnet Warrior]]\n* [[Buster Blader]]\n* [[Gamma The Magnet Warrior|Gamma the Magnet Warrior]]\n|spells =\n* [[Bounce Spell]]\n* [[Union Attack]]\n|traps =\n* [[Soul Rope]]\n}}\n\n{{Decklist|Tilla Mook\n|monsters =\n* [[Blood Sucker]]\n* [[Vampire Lady]]\n* [[Vampire's Curse]]\n|spells =\n* [[Overpowering Eye|Evil Eye of Coercion]]\n|traps =\n* [[Blood Curse]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n* {{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!

Championship Series under the name '''Yu-Gi-Oh! Championship Series Japan''', or '''YCSJ'''. There are usually two YCSJ tournaments a year. Each YCSJ consists of 2048 to 4000 participants who are selected through a lottery. \n\nUnlike ''TCG'' YCSes, the YCSJ is a one-day event that uses the Single Duel format. The first phase of the tournament consists of a 7 or 8-round [[wikipedia:Double-elimination tournament|double elimination]] format, while the top 64 players move on to a [[wikipedia:Single-elimination tournament|single elimination]] format. The top 4 or 8 decklists for each event are posted on the Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Database. \n\nPrize cards were not distributed at YCSJ Yokohama or YCSJ Osaka 2022. However, prize cards were distributed once again from YCSJ Tokyo 2023 onward. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable card-list\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Start date\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Winner\n! scope=\"col\" | Deck type\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n! scope=\"col\" | Ref\n|-\n| 2018-10-06 \n| [[Yu-Gi-Oh!

R]]'' between [[Dark Yugi (manga)|Dark Yugi]] and [[Maico Kato]].\n\n==Events==\n===Prior events===\nMacio was one of the thirteen [[Card Professor]]s hired by [[Yako Tenma]] to face [[Yugi Mutou (manga)|Yugi Mutou]] during [[Project R.A.]]\n\nAfter [[Dark Yugi and Kirk Dixon's Duel|defeating]] [[Kirk Dixon]], Yugi reached a point where his key card couldn't take him any further. He looked around for a Duelist and spotted Maico. At first, he didn't think Maico was a Duelist and asked her if she'd seen one. He pointed to his [[Duel Disk]] and asked if she'd seen anyone with something like that attached to their arm. Maico replied that she hadn't, but showed knowledge of ''[[Duel Monsters (manga)|Duel Monsters]]'' and soon identified herself as his opponent. A Duel Disk flooded out of a compartment on Maico's wheelchair and Yugi switched to [[Dark Yugi (manga)|Dark Yugi]].\n\n===The Duel===\n;Dark Yugi's turn\nDark Yugi [[Summon]]ed \"[[Big Shield Gardna]]\" in [[Defense Position]] ([[DEF]]: 2600).\n\n;Maico's turn\nMaico Summoned \"[[Leprechaun]]\" ([[ATK]]: 400) and [[equip]]ped it with \"[[Poison Crossbow]]\".\n\n\"Leprechaun\" [[attack]]ed \"Big Shield Gardna\". The effect of \"Poison Crossbow\" before [[damage calculation]].\n\nDark Yugi said it looked like Maico was a real Duelist after all. Maico replied that she was happy to hear that from the Duel King himself and wondered what she would buy for her grandchildren when she won the cash reward. Dark Yugi apologized and said that he was the one going to win.\n\n;Dark Yugi's turn\nDark Yugi Summoned \"[[Jack's Knight]]\" (ATK: 1800) and got it to attack \"Leprechaun\". However Maico activated \"[[Deep Forest]]\", allowing \"Leprechaun\" to hide from the attack.\n\n;Maico's turn\nMaico [[Set]] a card in the [[Spell & Trap Card Zone]].\n\n\"Leprechaun\" attacked \"Jack's Knight\" and the effect of \"Posion Crossbow\" destroyed \"Jack's Knight\".\n\nWith \"Leprechaun\" back in sight, Dark Yugi used \"[[Spellbinding Illusion]]\" to hold it in place and lower its ATK (ATK: 400 → 0).\n\n;Dark Yugi's turn\nDark Yugi Summoned \"[[Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts]]\" (ATK: 1500) and got it to attack \"Leprechaun\" (Maico: 4000 → 2500 [[Life Points]]).\n\nWith a member of the Forest family destroyed (In the English manga, the requirement was a [[Beast]]-[[Type]] monster), Maico was able to [[cost|pay]] 1000 Life Points (Maico: 2500 → 1500 Life Points) [[Special Summon]] \"[[Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest]]\" (ATK: 2600). Maico explained that the woods were weeping the death of one of its residents and this caused the forest's guardian to appear to get revenge.\n\n;Maico's turn\nDark Yugi thought he would be safe as he could use the effect of \"Deep Forest\" to hide \"Gazelle\" from attacks. However \"Maico\" equipped \"[[Chameleon Colors]]\" to \"Green Baboon\" camouflaging him into the forest and allowing him to attack Dark Yugi directly (Dark Yugi: 4000 → 1400 Life Points).\n\n;Dark Yugi's turn\nDark Yugi [[Tribute]]d \"Gazelle\" to Summon \"[[Archfiend of Gilfer]]\" (ATK: 2200) and activated \"[[Flames of the Archfiend]]\". Maico tried using \"[[De-Spell]]\" to [[negate]] it, but Dark Yugi also used \"De-Spell\" to negate her \"De-Spell\". \"Flames of the Archfiend\" destroyed \"Deep Forest\", inflicted 1000 damage to both players (Dark Yugi: 1400 → 400 Life Points, Maico: 1500 → 500 Life Points) and lowered the ATK of \"Green Baboon\" by 1000 (ATK: 2600 → 1600).\n\n\"Arhfiend of Gilfer\" attacked and destroyed \"Green Baboon\" (Macio: 400 → 0 Life Points), causing Dark Yugi to win.\n\n===Atermath===\nMaico gave Dark Yugi the next key car. Both players said that they were glad to have dueled each other and Maico said her grandchildren would love to hear this story.\n\n==Cards used==\n{{Decklist|Dark Yugi\n|monsters =\n* [[Archfiend of Gilfer]]\n* [[Big Shield Gardna]]\n* [[Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts]]\n* [[Jack's Knight]]\n|spells =\n* [[De-Spell]]\n* [[Flames of the Archfiend]]\n|traps =\n* [[Spellbinding Illusion]]\n}}\n\n{{Decklist|Maico Kato\n|monsters =\n* [[Green Baboon, Defender of the Forest]]\n* [[Leprechaun]]\n|spells =\n* [[Chameleon Colors]]\n* [[De-Spell]]\n* [[Deep Forest]]\n* [[Poison Crossbow]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n* {{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!

ZEXAL]]'' anime. \n\n==History==\n[[Kite Tenjo]] discovered a tablet detailing the legend when he returned to [[Jinlon]]'s [[Number ruins|ruins]] at one point. The tablet stated, \"Dragons of light and time, clash at thy place of birth. Then shall the eyes of the galaxies truly awaken for the first time, opening the gate to a new world.\" At this point Jinlon appeared and explained to [[Kite Tenjo|Kite]] the origin of the \"[[Galaxy-Eyes]]\" dragons.<ref name=\"ep133\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|133|ref}}</ref> He shared the legend with [[Quinton]], believing it was related to the [[Numeron Code]] and that said the Code would not function without the proper \"[[Number]]\" cards. He also determined the place of birth was actually the [[Moon]] and noted he wanted to battle [[Mizar]] there to test the legend's authenticity and determine who the true \"Galaxy-Eyes\" master was.<ref name=\"ep128\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL|128|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Monolith of the Moon.png|thumb|left|Tablet of the Moon]]\nAfter the [[Seven Barian Emperors]] attacked [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], Kite opted to head to the Moon.

According to the Number spirit, the legend regarding both \"Galaxy-Eyes\" monsters is actually a spell cast by a [[Number 100: Numeron Dragon (character)|dragon]] responsible for creating the Numeron Code in the first place. At last, Kite and Mizar's oncoming Duel would be able to break the spell, and thus whoever wins would obtain the key to use the Numeron Code itself.<ref name=\"ep133\">{{episode|Yu-Gi-Oh!

(manga)|''Yu-Gi-Oh!'' manga]]. This is the original depiction of the [[Millennium Ring]].\n\nThe Millennium Key is one of the seven [[Millennium Items (manga)|Millennium Items]], which were created to use as weapons to help Egypt defend from foreign invaders.\n\n==History==\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{See also|Millennium Items (manga)#Creation}}\nThe Millennium Items were created using shadow alchemy and a sacrifice of human lives in the [[Kul Elna massacre]], in order to protect the Egypt from foreign invaders. The first owner of the Millennium Ring was a [[High Priest]].<ref name=\"d 308\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|308|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe Millennium Ring was later passed on to [[Mahado (manga)|Mahado]],<ref name=\"d 283\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|283|ref}}</ref> when he became a Priest. Mahado realized the Ring possessed an evil power, which he suspected it absorbed from the previous Priest who wore it.<ref name=\"d 292\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|292|ref}}</ref> Through that evil, he learned of the truth of the Millennium Items' creation.<ref name=\"d 314\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|314|ref}}</ref> Using his own [[heka]], he used to suppressed the Ring's evil. Consequently, he could not use his heka for other things and relied on the same summoning magic that the other Priests used, significantly weakening his [[Magus of Illusion]] ''[[ka]]''.<ref name=\"d 292\" /> The next day, he notified the Pharaoh, [[Akhenamkhanen (manga)|Akhenamkhanen]], of how the Items were created. Having sanctioned the Item's creation, this caused Akhenamkhanen to fall ill and die.<ref name=\"d 314\" />\n\n[[File:Mahado senses Bakura's evil.png|thumb|left|300px|The Millennium Ring senses [[Bakura, King of Thieves (manga)|Bakura, King of Thieves]]' evil.]]\nMahado would receive omens from the Millennium Ring, notifying him of sinners and their evil intents, which aided him in his duties of protecting the royal tombs. Following an influx of ''[[ka]]'' residing in people's souls, this power became more erratic and the rate of tomb defilement rose. It notified Mahado of a particularly great shadow power when [[Bakura, King of Thieves (manga)|Bakura, King of Thieves]] approached the [[Pharaoh's palace]].<ref name=\"d 284\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|284|ref}}</ref>\n\nMahado set a trap for Bakura, where he sealed both of them in Akhenamkhanen's former tomb. Away from innocent bystanders, he stopped using his heka to suppress the dark powers of the Millennium Ring, allowing him to use it in [[Mahado and Bakura's Diaha (manga)|a ''Diaha'']] with Bakura.<ref name=\"d 284\" /> Mahado allowed himself to be killed in the ''Diaha'' to cast a spell fusing his ''ba'' with his Magus of Illusion ''ka''. With his sacrifice, he lost the Millennium Ring and seemed to kill Bakura.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|293|ref}}</ref> However, Bakura survived and took the Ring, absorbing its evil power.<ref name=\"d 297\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|297|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe Millennium Ring granted Bakura's ''ka'', [[Diabound (manga)|Diabound]], the power of camouflage. This made it easier for Bakura to sneak into the [[Shrine of Wedju]], where he [[Akhenaden and Bakura's Diaha (manga)|attacked]] [[Akhenaden (manga)|Akhenaden]]<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|298|ref}}</ref> and used the Millennium Ring's power to infuse part of his soul into Akhenaden's Millennium Eye to make him his pawn.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|299|ref}}</ref>\n\nPossessing the Millennium Ring enabled Bakura to summon ''ka'' from the Shrine of Wedju. He used it in [[Priests, Atem and Bakura's city Diaha (manga)|a ''Diaha'']] with the Atem and the High Priests to summon [[Illushu (manga)|Illushu]] as a decoy ''ka''.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|303|ref}}</ref> During the ''Diaha'', the Ring pointed towards the [[Millennium Puzzle (manga)|Millennium Pendant]], notifying Bakura that Atem was coming after him.<ref name=\"d 307\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|307|ref}}</ref>\n\nBakura brought the Millennium Ring and Pendant to the [[Shrine of the Millennium Stone|Shrine of the Underworld]] and placed them in the [[Millennium Stone|tablet]]. He noticed the needles on the Ring stirring, indicating other Millennium Item holders were approaching.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|312|ref}}</ref> Possessing two Millennium Items gave Bakura the ability to sustain two ''ka'' at once, allowing him to summon both Diabound and [[Bone Snapper (manga)|Bone Snapper]] in the [[Priests, Atem and Bakura's Kul Elna Diaha (manga)|ensuing ''Diaha'']].<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|315|ref}}</ref>\n\nBakura was defeated.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|319|ref}}</ref> However [[Akhenaden (manga)|Akhenaden]] acquired all the Millennium Items and placed them in a tablet, as part of a dark pact to gain power. He became the High Priest of Shadows and waged war with Atem.<ref name=\"d 305\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|305|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe Millennium Ring, similar to some of the other Items, came to house a soul from the past and functioned as a portable tomb.<ref name=\"d 50\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|50|ref}}</ref> The soul of [[Zorc Necrophades (manga)|Zorc Necrophades]] was sealed in the Millennium Ring, which later took the form of [[Dark Bakura (manga)|Dark Bakura]].<ref name=\"d 281\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|281|ref}}</ref><ref name=\"d 307\" />\n\n===Trials===\nThe Millennium Items were looked after by generations of Tomb Guardians with the Ring, [[Millennium Key (manga)|Key]], [[Millennium Scales (manga)|Scales]], and [[Millennium Eye (manga)|Eye]] eventually falling into the care of [[Shadi (manga)|Shadi]]. The Tomb Guardians saw it as their mission to find suitable hosts for the Items. They believed that if they did that they would find the other Millennium Items, as the Items are drawn to each other and when that time came the Items would be united in the [[Millennium Stone|Tablet of the Pharaoh's Memories]].<ref name=\"d 132\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|132|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ring thief death.png|thumb|right|300px|The Millennium Ring rejecting [[Millennium Ring thief|a thief]] as its host]]\n[[Millennium Ring thief|A thief]] tried to steal the Millennium Ring at [[Kul Elna]], but was caught by the Tomb Guardians. He tried to hand back the Ring, but the Tomb Guardians insisted on taking him away. [[Maximillion J. Pegasus (manga)|Maximillion J. Pegasus]] witnessed the ordeal and fearing for the thief's safety, offered to pay for the Ring if they would let him go. [[Shadi Shin|Shadi]] replied that the value of the Ring was irrelevant, albeit immeasurable. The thief was brought to the [[Shrine of the Millennium Stone|Shrine of the Underworld]] and Shadi told the man that they did not intend to condemn him for the theft. Rather, he they were to test if they was a chosen one; if the Millennium Ring would accept him as its bearer. The Ring was placed around his neck. However, it rejected him as a host, dug its prongs into his skin and caused fire to burst out of his eyes and mouth, killing him.<ref name=\"d 132\" />\n\n[[File:Tdsod ryofather.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Bakura's father (manga)|Ryo Bakura's father]] tries on the Millennium Ring.]]\n[[Bakura's father (manga)|Ryo Bakura's father]] grew a fascination for the Millennium Ring and spent most of his life searching for it. His investigations led him to believe it was located in the [[Valley of the Kings]], so he and his son, [[Ryo Bakura (manga)|Ryo]] traveled to Egypt. Ryo, fearing his father would be in danger, secretly followed him during the a trip to find the Millennium Ring. While Shadi was lecturing the [[Prana]] children in the shrine, Bakura's father entered and offered to pay money for the Ring. Shadi explained that the Ring was not for sale, rather it would test people to see if they were worthy hosts. Bakura's father put the Ring on for the test and momentarily felt good, before the Ring ultimately rejected him and flung him across the chamber.<ref name=\"dsod\">''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions]]''</ref>\n\n[[File:Dark Bakura-DSOD.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Dark Bakura (manga)|Dark Bakura]] emerges from the Millennium Ring.]]\nRyo emerged to help his father, who instead urged him to get the Ring. Ryo picked up the Ring, which then accepted him as its owner and its contained evil manifested as [[Dark Bakura (manga)|Dark Bakura]]. Dark Bakura took control of Ryo and fused the Millennium Ring into his body, causing it to disappear under his skin. Dark Bakura then used the Ring's power to kill Shadi. Ryo suppressed memories of the incident<ref name=\"dsod\" /> and came to believe [[Bakura's father (manga)|his father]] purchased the Millennium Ring from an antique shop in Egypt.<ref name=\"d 63\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|63|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Monster World===\n[[File:Enter Dark Bakura.png|thumb|left|x300px|Dark Bakura sticks the Millennium Ring's prongs into [[Ryo Bakura (manga)|Ryo Bakura]]'s flesh.]]\nThe Millennium Ring allowed [[Dark Bakura (manga)|Dark Bakura]] to take control of [[Ryo Bakura (manga)|Ryo Bakura]]'s body, without him knowing, and turn the games he played with his friends into [[Shadow Game]]s. As Dark Bakura defeated Bakura's friends, he used the Ring to inflict the \"Mind Doll\" [[Penalty Game]], trapping their souls in ''[[Monster World]]'' miniatures<ref name=\"d 50\" /> or [[brainwashed dice]],<ref name=\"d 56\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|56|ref}}</ref> leaving their human bodies in comas. Unaware of what caused that to happen to his friends, Bakura kept changing schools and tried to distance himself from new people.<ref name=\"d 50\" />\n\nRyo Bakura transferred to [[Domino High School]] and learned that [[Yugi Mutou (manga)|Yugi Mutou]] possessed the [[Millennium Puzzle (manga)|Millennium Puzzle]]. He was about to tell him that he had a similar item, but stopped after feeling a pain in his chest. He turned down Yugi's offer to play ''Monster World'' after school, fearing what happened to his other friends.<ref name=\"d 50\" />\n\n[[File:Karita's Penalty Game.png|thumb|right|300px|Dark Bakura uses the Millennium Ring to trap [[Mr. Karita]]'s soul in a miniature.]]\nThe Millennium Ring would sometimes point one of its needles in the direction of the Millennium Puzzle.<ref name=\"d 85\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|85|ref}}</ref> The two Millennium Items coming close together caused them to resonate, granting Dark Bakura the ability to communicate with Ryo Bakura. He introduced himself and pierced the prongs of the Ring into Ryo's chest to prevent him from removing it. Dark Bakura claimed to pay rent by granting Ryo wishes, including his desire to be able to play games with his friends forever. That night he \"paid rent\" by using the Ring to turn [[Mr. Karita]], who had bullied Ryo earlier, into a ''Monster World'' miniature.<ref name=\"d 50\" />\n\nThe next day, Yugi and his friends arrived at [[Bakura's apartment]] to play ''Monster World''. Dark Bakura posed as Ryo<ref name=\"d 50\" /> and made their ''Monster World'' campaign into a Shadow Game to try and steal the Millennium Puzzle.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|52|ref}}</ref> Using the Ring he sealed Ryo's friends' souls into their game pieces, until only [[Dark Yugi (manga)|Dark Yugi]] was left to roll the dice for Ryo's friends.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|53|ref}}</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign, Dark Bakura made use of the [[brainwashed dice]] he had created using the Millennium Ring to control the outcome of his dice rolls.<ref name=\"d 56\" /> But Ryo interfered with his plays, swapping the brainwashed dice for regular dice and making the brainwashed dice land on undesired numbers.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|57|ref}}</ref> Dark Bakura later used the Ring to seal a part of his own soul into [[doppelganger dice]]. However he unwittingly sealed Ryo's soul in the dice too, enabling Ryo to make the dice self-destruct and void their roll. Dark Yugi won the game and restored all souls sealed in gaming pieces to their original bodies.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|59|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Duelist Kingdom===\nThe Millennium Ring at some point stopped pointing towards the Puzzle.<ref name=\"d 85\" />\n\n[[File:Millennium Ring pointing.png|thumb|left|300px|Ryo discovers the Millennium Ring is pointing towards [[Pegasus Castle]].]]\nRyo Bakura stopped wearing the Ring to prevent Dark Bakura from controlling him. Despite concern from his friends, he still kept it near him, considering it to be harmless as long as he did not put it on. He remained fascinated by the Millennium Items, wishing to know their purpose origin. He suspected they might get answers from [[Maximillion J. Pegasus (manga)|Maximillion J. Pegasus]] when Yugi participated in the [[Duelist Kingdom]] tournament.<ref name=\"d 63\" />\n\nDuring the first night of the tournament, Ryo checked on the Millennium Ring and discovered it was pointing in the direction of [[Pegasus Castle]] and suspected it was pointing towards the [[Millennium Eye (manga)|Millennium Eye]].<ref name=\"d 85\" /> The next day, Ryo made use of this information when he and his friends were lost underground, as they were able to use the Ring to know which direction they were traveling.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|92|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D-039 Dark Bakura's advice.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dark Bakura encourages Ryo to put the Ring back on.]]\nIn order for Ryo and his friends to escape the underground, Dark Yugi and [[Katsuya Jonouchi (manga)|Katsuya Jonouchi]] needed to defeat the [[Meikyû Brothers (manga)|Meikyû Brothers]] and answer their riddle about which door led to the exit. As Ryo searched the area for a possible third door, Dark Bakura spoke to him through the Millennium Ring. He urged Ryo to put the Ring on, so that he could help identify the correct door, insisting it would be easy for a thief like him. Ryo refused, but eventually gave into the fear of everyone getting trapped and put it on. [[Dark Bakura (manga)|Dark Bakura]] coped the Meikyû Brothers planned on saying the correct door was whichever one Dark Yugi did not choose and helped Dark Yugi fool them into misreading Dark Yugi's guess before they revealed the correct door. He returned control to Ryo before they left.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|98|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Dungeon Dice Monsters===\nOutside the [[Black Clown]], the Millennium Ring alerted Dark Bakura that something had happened to the Millennium Puzzle when [[Mr. Clown]] took it from Yugi and dismantled it.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|140|ref}}</ref> Since the Millennium Ring and Puzzle contained memories destined to be reunited and Yugi was the only host chosen by the Puzzle in the past 3000 years, Dark Bakura needed Yugi to remain its wielder, so he sought to help him.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|141|ref}}</ref>\n\nDark Bakura observed the ''[[Dungeon Dice Monsters (manga)|Dungeon Dice Monsters]]'' game that Yugi and [[Ryuji Otogi (manga)|Ryuji Otogi]] were playing and offered some encouragement to Yugi.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|143|ref}}</ref> Yugi won the game and Dark Bakura secretly used the Millennium Ring's \"[[Parasite Mind (ability)|Parasite Mind]]\" ability to seal a portion of his soul in a piece of the dismantled Millennium Puzzle, before handing it to Yugi.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|144|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Battle City===\nDuring the [[Battle City]] ''[[Duel Monsters (manga)|Duel Monsters]]'' tournament, the Millennium Ring detected the nearby presence of the [[Millennium Rod (manga)|Millennium Rod]] and pointed one of its prongs in its direction, leading Dark Bakura to its holder [[Marik Ishtar (manga)|Marik Ishtar]]<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|178|ref}}</ref>\n\nMarik had [[Rishid (manga)|Rishid]] pretend to be him for the tournament finals. Ryo Bakura was brainwashed by Marik, whom Dark Bakura was conspiring with, and he aided in the deception by showing his friends that the Millennium Ring was pointing to Rishid as he carried the Millennium Rod.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|202|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anzu takes the Millennium Ring.png|thumb|left|300px|[[Anzu Mazaki (manga)|Anzu]] takes the Millennium Ring, while brainwashed.]]\nDark Bakura lost to Dark Yugi in the quarterfinals and Ryo's existing injury caused him to fall unconscious after the final attack. The Millennium Ring fell from his body and was picked up by [[Anzu Mazaki (manga)|Anzu Mazaki]], who figured it had allowed Dark Bakura to take over Ryo's body again. Under Marik's brainwashing, she offered to look after the Ring herself, saying she would keep it away from Ryo.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|209|ref}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dark Marik with Ring and unsheated Rod.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Dark Marik (manga)|Dark Marik]] with the Millennium Ring]]\nThe brainwashed Anzu returned the Millennium Ring to Ryo, after Marik lost control of his own body to [[Dark Marik (manga)|Dark Marik]]. This allowed Dark Bakura to emerge again and speak with the portion of Marik that had been implanted in Ryo's mind. He agreed to prevent Dark Marik from killing Rishid in exchange for seeing the [[Seal of Memories]] and taking the Millennium Rod. The two confronted Dark Marik, who used the Rod's power to pin Dark Bakura to a wall. However Dark Bakura used the Ring's power to free himself and immobolize Dark Marik's arm. As Millennium Item holders they agreed to settle things in a [[Shadow Game]],<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|233|ref}}</ref> by playing ''Duel Monsters''. Dark Marik emerged victorious, causing Ryo's body to disappear, leaving just the Ring, which Dark Marik claimed.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|236|ref}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Dark Yugi and Dark Marik's Duel (manga)|tournament final]], Dark Marik taunted Dark Yugi by revealing what he did to Bakura, while showing him that he now had the Millennium Ring.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|269|ref}}</ref> Marik regained control of his body at the climax of the Duel and surrendered dispelling Dark Marik.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|276|ref}}</ref> Afterwards, he gave both the Ring and Rod to Dark Yugi.<ref name=\"d 277\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|277|ref}}</ref>\n\nDark Marik's defeat allowed Ryo to regain consciousness. He asked Dark Yugi if he knew the Millennium Ring's whereabouts, but Dark Yugi elected to lie, not wanting Ryo to get possessed again.<ref name=\"d 277\" /> However Ryo later happened upon the Ring in Yugi's room and put it back on.<ref>{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|278|ref}}</ref>\n\n===Pharaoh's Memories===\nDark Bakura stopped [[God Card thief|a thief]] who had stolen the [[Egyptian God|God cards]]. He returned them to [[Yugi Mutou (manga)|Yugi]], who thanked him but noted he was wearing the Millennium Ring. Dark Bakura insisted that the Ring belonged to him, despite the inconvenience Ryo's theft may have caused Yugi. Despite that, he explained that he intended to hand the Ring over to Yugi when the time came for him to use the seven Millennium Items.<ref name=\"d 280\">{{chapter|Yu-Gi-Oh!|280|ref}}</ref> Yugi questioned Dark Bakura's willingness to help him and he explained that he is soul that was sealed in the Millennium Ring for 3000 years and like Dark Yugi, he wished to go to the afterlife.<ref name=\"d 281\" />\n\nRyo was denied opportunity to travel to the [[World of Memories]] after [[Bobasa (manga)|Bobasa]] detected evil in his heart with the [[Millennium Scales (manga)|Millennium Scales]].
